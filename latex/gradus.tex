% Change log
%
% v3.0 May 2015
%    Renamed to match the new package name
%    Version number matches mnras.cls
%    A few minor tweaks to wording

%    First version: a simple (ish) template for creating an MNRAS paper

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% Basic setup. Most papers should leave these options alone.
\documentclass[fleqn,usenatbib]{mnras}

% MNRAS is set in Times font. If you don't have this installed (most LaTeX
% installations will be fine) or prefer the old Computer Modern fonts, comment
% out the following line
\usepackage{newtxtext,newtxmath}
% Depending on your LaTeX fonts installation, you might get better results with one of these:
%\usepackage{mathptmx}
%\usepackage{txfonts}

% Use vector fonts, so it zooms properly in on-screen viewing software
% Don't change these lines unless you know what you are doing
\usepackage[T1]{fontenc}

% Allow "Thomas van Noord" and "Simon de Laguarde" and alike to be sorted by "N" and "L" etc. in the bibliography.
% Write the name in the bibliography as "\VAN{Noord}{Van}{van} Noord, Thomas"
\DeclareRobustCommand{\VAN}[3]{#2}

%% INTRODUCTION
\input{gradus.introduction.tex}

%% NUMERICAL METHODS
\input{gradus.numerical-methods.tex}

\input{gradus.code.tex}

\section{Test problems}

\subsection{Integration accuracy and stability}

\todo{Angular deflection $\Delta \phi$}

Derived semi-analytically in \cite{iyer_lights_2009} (presented compactly and extended for metrics of form \eqref{eq:static_axisymmetric_metric} in Appendix \ref{appendix:deflection-angle}).

Since our method for integration does not use the constants of motion directly, the stability of the integrator may also be gauged by sampling invariant quantities along the trajectory. In Figure \ref{fig:constants-of-motion} is shown the value of $v_\mu v^\mu$, as in \eqref{eq:velocity_constraint}, for a number of trajectories.

\todo{Energy conservation, deflection problem, shadow, tests for naked-singularities}

\subsection{Analytic radiative transfer problems}

Do some of that Gold (2022) paper with all the test problems

\subsection{Geodesic throughput}

How fast are we exactly?

\section{Applications}

\subsection{Iron line profiles}

Bambi's various metrics and relline, self consistency between methods

\subsection{Lag-frequency spectra}

Ingram's code? Jiachen's code

\subsection{Emissivity curves}

\todo{Wilkins and Fabian with lamp post and moving corona, gonzalez 2017}

% Note this is not an exhaustive list!
% Thick discs
% Non-Kerr spacetimes, e.g., Johannsen metric but with complete parameter freedom
% Cunningham transfer functions and comparison / correction with, e.g., Bambi paper
% 2D transfer functions
% 	Time lags versus frequency
% 	Time lags versus energy


% Description of how the community can use Gradus and how to make table models.

\section{Conclusions}

Outlook

We encourage the community to contact us with interesting problems that may be tackled using \Gradus as we are happy to assist with new applications of the code.

% Note future work, e.g., with regard to fitting, and using the code in other papers

\section*{Data Availability}

% The inclusion of a Data Availability Statement is a requirement for articles published in MNRAS. Data Availability Statements provide a standardised format for readers to understand the availability of data underlying the research results described in the article. The statement may refer to original data generated in the course of the study or to third-party data analysed in the article. The statement should describe and provide means of access, where possible, by linking to the data or providing the required accession numbers for the relevant databases or DOIs.
