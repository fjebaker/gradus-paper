The strong, broad, skewed iron line is clearly detected and is well characterized by a steep emissivity proﬁle within 6rg (i.e. 6G M/c2) and a ﬂatter proﬁle beyond. The inner radius of the emission appears to lie at about 2rg, consistent with results reported from both an earlier XMM-Newton observation of MCG–6-30-15 by Wilms et al. and part of an ASCA observation by Iwasawa et al. when the source was in a lower ﬂux state. The radius and steep emissivity proﬁle do depend however on an assumed incident power-law continuum and a lack of complex absorption above 2.5 keV. The blue wing of the line proﬁle is indented, either by absorption at about 6.7 keV or by a hydrogenic iron emission line. The broad iron line ﬂux does not follow the continuum variations in a simple manner.},

	abstract = {The Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) Collaboration has recently produced the ﬁrst resolved images of the central supermassive black hole in the giant elliptical galaxy M87. Here we report on tests of the consistency and accuracy of the general relativistic radiative transfer codes used within the collaboration to model M87* and Sgr A*. We compare and evaluate (1) deﬂection angles for equatorial null geodesics in a Kerr spacetime; (2) images calculated from a series of simple, parameterized matter distributions in the Kerr metric using simpliﬁed emissivities and absorptivities; (3) for a subset of codes, images calculated from general relativistic magnetohydrodynamics simulations using different realistic synchrotron emissivities and absorptivities; (4) observables for the 2017 conﬁguration of EHT, including visibility amplitudes and closure phases. The error in total ﬂux is of order 1\% when the codes are run with production numerical parameters. The dominant source of discrepancies for small camera distances is the location and detailed setup of the software “camera” that each code uses to produce synthetic images. We ﬁnd that when numerical parameters are suitably chosen and the camera is sufﬁciently far away the images converge and that for given transfer coefﬁcients, numerical uncertainties are unlikely to limit parameter estimation for the current generation of EHT observations. The purpose of this paper is to describe a veriﬁcation and comparison of EHT radiative transfer codes. It is not to verify EHT models more generally.},

Here we neglect them and present an algorithm for the construction of Runge–Kutta pairs of orders 5 and 4 based only in the first column simplifying assumption.

This is the only stationary, vacuum, axisymmetric metric, without electromagnetic charge, that satisfies Einstein’s equations and does not have pathologies outside of the event horizon. We present new constraints on potential deviations from the Kerr prediction based on 2017 EHT observations of Sagittarius A∗ (Sgr A∗). We calibrate the relationship between the geometrically defined black hole shadow and the observed size of the ring-like images using a library that includes both Kerr and non-Kerr simulations. We use the exquisite prior constraints on the mass-to-distance ratio for Sgr A∗ to show that the observed image size is within ∼ 10\% of the Kerr predictions. We use these bounds to constrain metrics that are parametrically different from Kerr as well as the charges of several known spacetimes. To consider alternatives to the presence of an event horizon we explore the possibility that Sgr A∗ is a compact object with a surface that either absorbs and thermally re-emits incident radiation or partially reflects it. Using the observed image size and the broadband spectrum of Sgr A∗, we conclude that a thermal surface can be ruled out and a fully reflective one is unlikely. We compare our results to the broader landscape of gravitational tests. Together with the bounds found for stellar mass black holes and the M87 black hole, our observations provide further support that the external spacetimes of all black holes are described by the Kerr metric, independent of their mass.},

	abstract = {As mathematical computing becomes more democratized in high-level languages, high-performance symbolic-numeric systems are necessary for domain scientists and engineers to get the best performance out of their machine without deep knowledge of code optimization. Naturally, users need different term types either to have different algebraic properties for them, or to use efficient data structures. To this end, we developed Symbolics.jl, an extendable symbolic system which uses dynamic multiple dispatch to change behavior depending on the domain needs. In this work we detail an underlying abstract term interface which allows for speed without sacrificing generality. We show that by formalizing a generic API on actions independent of implementation, we can retroactively add optimized data structures to our system without changing the pre-existing term rewriters. We showcase how this can be used to optimize term construction and give a 113x acceleration on general symbolic transformations. Further, we show that such a generic API allows for complementary term-rewriting implementations. Exploiting this feature, we demonstrate the ability to swap between classical term-rewriting simplifiers and e-graph-based term-rewriting simplifiers. We illustrate how this symbolic system improves numerical computing tasks by showcasing an e-graph ruleset which minimizes the number of CPU cycles during expression evaluation, and demonstrate how it simplifies a real-world reaction-network simulation to halve the runtime. Additionally, we show a reaction-diffusion partial differential equation solver which is able to be automatically converted into symbolic expressions via multiple dispatch tracing, which is subsequently accelerated and parallelized to give a 157x simulation speedup. Together, this presents Symbolics.jl as a next-generation symbolic-numeric computing environment geared towards modeling and simulation.},

	abstract = {In this paper, we study the properties of accretion flow including its spectral features in Johannsen and Psaltis (JP) non-Kerr spacetime. In doing so, we numerically solve the governing equations that describe the flow motion around the compact objects in a general relativistic framework, where spin (\$a\_\{k\}\$) and deformation parameters (\${\textbackslash}varepsilon\$) demonstrate the nature of the central source, namely black hole (BH) or naked singularity (NS). With this, we obtain all possible classes of global accretion solutions (\$i. e.\$, O, A, W and I-type) by varying the energy (\$E\$) and angular momentum (\${\textbackslash}lambda\$) of the relativistic accretion flow, and examine the role of thermal bremsstrahlung emission in studying the spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of the accretion disc. We divide the parameter space in \${\textbackslash}lambda-E\$ plane in terms of the different classes of accretion solutions for BH and NS models. We further calculate the disc luminosity (\$L\$) corresponding to these accretion solutions, and observe that I-type solutions yield higher \$L\$ and SEDs than the remaining types of solutions for both BH and NS models. For BH model, SEDs for W and I-type solutions differ significantly from the results for O and A-type solutions for low \$E\$ values. On the contrary, for NS model, SEDs for different accretion solutions are identical in the whole parameter space of \${\textbackslash}lambda\$ and \$E\$. We also examine the effect of \${\textbackslash}varepsilon\$ on the SEDs and observe that a non-Kerr BH yields higher SEDs than the usual Kerr BH. Finally, for accretion solutions of identical \$E\$ and \${\textbackslash}lambda\$, we compare the SEDs obtained from BH and NS models, and find that naked singularity objects produce more luminous power spectra than the black holes.},

	abstract = {We present a general formulation for ray-tracing calculations in curved space-time. The formulation takes full account of relativistic eﬀects in the photon transport and the relative motions of the emitters and the light-of-sight absorbing material. We apply the formulation to calculate the emission from accretion disks and tori around rotating black holes. In our model the emission lines and continuum originate from an accretion disk or torus, and the motion of the emitters in the disk/torus is determined by the gravity of the black hole and the spacetime structure near the black hole. The line-of-sight absorbing medium is comprised of cold absorbing cloudlets. These cloudlets are kinematically hot, with their velocity dispersion determined by the local virial temperature. The emission from the accretion disk/torus is resonantly absorbed/scattered. Our calculations demonstrate that line-of-sight absorption signiﬁcantly modiﬁes the proﬁles of lines from the accretion disks. It is often diﬃcult to disentangle absorption eﬀects from other geometrical and kinematics eﬀects, such as the viewing inclination and the spin of the black hole. Our calculations also show that emission lines from accretion tori and from thin accretion disks diﬀer substantially. Large geometrical obscuration could occur in tori, and as a consequence lines from tori generally have much weaker redshift wings at large viewing inclination angles. Moreover, the blue peak is truncated.},
