	abstract = {The Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) has recently released high resolution images of accretion ﬂows onto two supermassive black holes. Our physical understanding of these images depends on accuracy and precision of numerical models of plasma and radiation around compact objects. The goal of this work is to speedup radiative transfer simulations used to create mock images of black holes for comparison with the EHT observations. A ray-tracing code for general relativistic and fully polarized radiative transfer through plasma in strong gravity is ported onto GPU. We describe our GPU implementation and carry out speedup tests using models of optically thin advection dominated accretion ﬂow onto black hole realized semi-analytically and in 3-D GRMHD simulations, low and very high image pixel resolutions, and two diﬀerent sets of CPU+GPUs. We show that a GPU unit with high double precision compute capability can signiﬁcantly reduce the image production computational time, with speedup factor up to approximately 1200. The signiﬁcant speedup facilitates, e.g., dynamic model ﬁtting to the EHT data, including polariemtric data. The method extension may enable studies of emission from plasma with nonthermal particle distribution functions for which accurate approximate synchrotron emissivities are not available. The signiﬁcant speedup reduces the carbon footprint of the EHT image libraries generation by at least an order of magnitude.},

	abstract = {Using backwards ray tracing, we study the shadows of Kerr black holes with scalar hair (KBHsSH). KBHsSH interpolate continuously between Kerr BHs and boson stars (BSs), so we start by investigating the lensing of light due to BSs. Moving from the weak to the strong gravity region, BSs - which by themselves have no shadows - are classified, according to the lensing produced, as: \$(i)\$ non-compact, which yield no multiple images; \$(ii)\$ compact, which produce an increasing number of Einstein rings and multiple images of the whole celestial sphere; \$(iii)\$ ultra-compact, which possess light rings, yielding an infinite number of images with (we conjecture) a self-similar structure. The shadows of KBHsSH, for Kerr-like horizons and non-compact BS-like hair, are analogous to, but distinguishable from, those of comparable Kerr BHs. But for non-Kerr-like horizons and ultra-compact BS-like hair, the shadows of KBHsSH are drastically different: novel shapes arise, sizes are considerably smaller and multiple shadows of a single BH become possible. Thus, KBHsSH provide quantitatively and qualitatively new templates for ongoing (and future) very large baseline interferometry (VLBI) observations of BH shadows, such as those of the Event Horizon Telescope.},

	abstract = {4U 1957+11 is a black hole candidate system that has been in a soft X-ray spectral state since its discovery. We present analyses of recent joint NICER and NuSTAR spectra, which are extremely well-described by a highly inclined disk accreting into a near maximally spinning black hole. Owing to the broad X-ray coverage of NuSTAR the fitted spin and inclination are strongly constrained for our hypothesized disk models. The faintest spectra are observed out to 20 keV, even though their hard tail components are almost absent when described with a simple corona. The hard tail increases with luminosity, but shows clear two track behavior with one track having appreciably stronger tails. The disk spectrum color-correction factor is anti-correlated with the strength of the hard tail (e.g., as measured by the Compton \$y\$ parameter). Although the spin and inclination parameters are strongly constrained for our chosen model, the mass and distance are degenerate parameters. We use our spectral fits, along with a theoretical prior on color-correction, an observational prior on likely fractional Eddington luminosity, and an observational prior on distance obtained from Gaia studies, to present mass and distance contours for this system. The most likely parameters, given our presumed disk model, suggest a 4.6 \${\textbackslash}mathrm\{M\_{\textbackslash}odot\}\$ black hole at 7.8 kpc observed at luminosities ranging from \${\textbackslash}approx 1.7{\textbackslash}\%\$--\$9{\textbackslash}\%\$ of Eddington. This would place 4U 1957+11 as one of the few actively accreting sources within the `mass gap' of \$\{{\textbackslash}approx\} 2\$--\$5{\textbackslash},{\textbackslash}mathrm\{M\_{\textbackslash}odot\}\$ where there are few known massive neutron stars or low mass black holes. Higher mass and distance, however, remain viable.},

	abstract = {A standard problem in gamma-ray astronomy data analysis is the decomposition of a set of observed counts, described by Poisson statistics, according to a given multicomponent linear model, with underlying physical count rates or fluxes which are to be estimated from the data. Despite its conceptual simplicity, the linear least-squares (LLSQ) method for solving this problem has generally been limited to situations in which the number ni of counts in each bin i is not too small, conventionally more than 5-30. It seems to be widely believed that the failure of the LLSQ method for small counts is due to the failure of the Poisson distribution to be even approximately normal for small numbers. The cause is more accurately the strong anticorrelation between the data and the wieghts wi in the weighted LLSQ method when square root of ni instead of square root of bar-ni is used to approximate the uncertainties, sigmai, in the data, where bar-ni = E(ni), the expected value of Ni. We show in an appendix that, avoiding this approximation, the correct equations for the Poisson LLSQ (PLLSQ) problems are actually identical to those for the maximum likelihood estimate using the exact Poisson distribution. We apply the method to solve a problem in high-resolution gamma-ray spectroscopy for the JPL High-Resolution Gamma-Ray Spectrometer flown on HEAO 3. Systematic error in subtracting the strong, highly variable background encountered in the low-energy gamma-ray region can be significantly reduced by closely pairing source and background data in short segments. Significant results can be built up by weighted averaging of the net fluxes obtained from the subtraction of many individual source/background pairs. Extension of the approach to complex situations, with multiple cosmic sources and realistic background parameterizations, requires a means of efficiently fitting to data from single scans in the narrow (approximately = 1.2 keV, HEAO 3) energy channels of a Ge spectrometer, where the expected number of counts obtained per scan may be very low. Such an analysis system is discussed and compared to the method previously used.},

XGA only requires that a set of cleaned, processed, event lists has been created, and (optionally) that a source detector has generated region lists for the observations. XGA is centered around the concept of making all available data easily accessible and analysable. The user provides information (e.g. RA, Dec, redshift) on the source they wish to investigate, and XGA will locate all relevant observations and generate all required data products. This approach means that the user can quickly and easily complete common analyses without manually searching through large amounts of archival data for relevant observations, thus being left free to focus on extracting the maximum scientiﬁc gain. In the future, we will add support for X-ray telescopes other than XMM (e.g. Chandra, eROSITA), as well as the ability to perform multi-mission joint analyses. With the advent of new X-ray observatories such as eROSITA (Predehl et al., 2021), XRISM (XRISM Science Team, 2020), ATHENA (Nandra et al., 2013), and Lynx (Gaskin et al., 2019), it is the perfect time for a new, open-source, software package that is open for anyone to use and scrutinise.},

We provide estimates of how phenomenologically interesting parameters like the ‘radiation edge’, the innermost ring of the disc from which substantial thermal radiation escapes to inﬁnity, may be altered by stresses near the ISCO. These estimates are based on data from a large number of three-dimensional GRMHD simulations combined with GR ray tracing. For slowly spinning black holes (a/M {\textless} 0.9), the radiation edge lies well inside where the standard model predicts, particularly when the system is viewed at high inclination. For more rapidly spinning black holes, the contrast is smaller. At ﬁxed total luminosity, the characteristic temperature of the accretion ﬂow increases between a factor of 1.2 and 2.4 over that predicted by the standard model, whilst at ﬁxed mass accretion rate, there is a corresponding enhancement of the accretion luminosity which may be anywhere from tens of per cent to order unity. When all these considerations are combined, we ﬁnd that, for ﬁxed black hole mass, luminosity and inclination angle, our uncertainty in the characteristic temperature of the radiation reaching distant observers due to uncertainty in dissipation proﬁle (around a factor of 3) is greater than the uncertainty due to a complete lack of knowledge of the black hole’s spin (around a factor of 2) and furthermore that spin estimates based on the stress-free inner boundary condition provide an upper limit to a/M.},

axis of the black hole. The spectroscopic features imprinted in the
reflection component are modelled using REFLIONX. The associated time
delays after the direct continuum, known as reverberation lags, are
computed including the full effects of dilution and ionization gradients
on the disc. We perform, for the first time, simultaneous fitting of the
time-averaged and lag-energy spectra in three AGN: Mrk 335, IRAS
13224-3809 and Ark 564 observed with XMM-Newton. The best-fitting source
height and central mass of each AGN partly agree with those previously
reported. We find that including the ionization gradient in the model
naturally explains lag-energy observations in which the 3 keV and 7-10
keV bands precede other bands. To obtain the clear 3 keV and 7-10 keV
dips in the lag-energy profile, the model requires either a source
height {\textgreater}5 rg, or a disc that is highly ionized at small
radii and is colder further out. We also show that fitting the lag or
the mean spectra alone can lead to different results and
interpretations. This is therefore important to combine the spectral and

This signal allows us to spatially map the geometry of the inner accretion flow1,2—a region that cannot yet be spatially resolved by any telescope—and provides a direct measure of the black hole mass and spin. The reverberation timescale is set by the light travel path between the direct emission from a hot X-ray corona and the reprocessed emission from the inner edge of the accretion disk3–6. However, there is an inherent degeneracy in the reverberation signal between black hole mass, inner disk radius and height of the illuminating corona above the disk. Here we use a long X-ray observation of the highly variable active galaxy IRAS 13224−3809 to track the reverberation signal as the system evolves on timescales of a day7,8. With the inclusion of all the relativistic effects, modelling reveals that the height of the X-ray corona increases with increasing luminosity, providing a dynamic view of the inner accretion region. This simultaneous modelling allows us to break the inherent degeneracies and obtain an independent timing-based estimate for the mass and spin of the black hole. The uncertainty on black hole mass is comparable to the leading optical reverberation method9, making X-ray reverberation a powerful technique, particularly for sources with low optical variability10.},

	abstract = {The illumination pattern (or emissivity profile) of the accretion disc due to the reflection of X-rays in active galactic nucleus can be understood in terms of relativistic effects on the rays propagating from a source in a corona surrounding the central black hole, both on their trajectories and on the accretion disc itself. Theoretical emissivity profiles due to isotropic point sources as well as simple extended geometries are computed in general relativistic ray-tracing simulations performed on graphics processing units (GPUs). Such simulations assuming only general relativity naturally explain the accretion disc emissivity profiles determined from relativistically broadened emission lines which fall off steeply (with power-law indices of between 6 and 8) over the inner regions of the disc, then flattening off to almost a constant before tending to a constant power law of index 3 over the outer disc. Simulations for a variety of source locations, extents and geometries show how the emissivity profiles depend on these properties, and when combined with reverberation time lags allow the location and extent of the primary X-ray source to be constrained. Comparing the emissivity profile determined from the broadened iron K emission line in spectra of 1H 0707-495 obtained in 2008 January to theoretical emissivity profiles and applying constraints from reverberation lags suggest that there exists an extended region of primary X-ray emission located as low as 2rg above the accretion disc, extending outwards to a radius of around 30rg.},

The transport step is implemented to be as spacetime- and coordinate- independent as possible. The emission, absorption, and Faraday conversion step is implemented using an analytic solution to the polarized transport equation with constant coefﬁcients. As a result, IPOLE is stable, efﬁcient, and produces a physically reasonable solution even for a step with high optical depth and Faraday depth. We show that the code matches analytic results in ﬂat space, and that it produces results that converge to those produced by Dexter’s GRTRANS polarized transport code on a complicated model problem.

	abstract = {We study reflected X-ray emission that returns to the accretion disc in the strong gravitational fields around black holes using General Relativistic ray-tracing and radiative transfer calculations. Reflected X-rays that are produced when the inner regions of the disc are illuminated by the corona are subject to strong gravitational light bending, causing up to 47 per cent of the reflected emission to be returned to the disc around a rapidly spinning black hole, depending upon the scale height of the corona. The iron Kα line is enhanced relative to the continuum by 25 per cent, and the Compton hump by up to a factor of 3. Additional light traveltime between primary and secondary reflections increases the reverberation time lag measured in the iron K band by 49 per cent, while the soft X-ray lag is increased by 25 per cent and the Compton hump response time is increased by 60 per cent. Measured samples of X-ray reverberation lags are shown to be consistent with X-rays returning to the accretion disc in strong gravity. Understanding the effects of returning radiation is important in interpreting reverberation observations to probe black holes. Reflected X-rays returning to the disc can be uniquely identified by blueshifted returning iron K line photons that are Compton scattered from the inner disc, producing excess, delayed emission in the 3.5-4.5 keV energy range that will be detectable with forthcoming X-ray observatories, representing a unique test of General Relativity in the strong field limit.},

We confirm the previous discovery of reverberation lags in the hard state, and find that the frequency range where the (soft) reverberation lag dominates decreases with the reverberation lag amplitude increasing during the transition, suggesting an increasing X-ray emitting region, possibly due to an expanding corona. By jointly fitting the lag-energy spectra in a number of broad frequency ranges with the reverberation model reltrans, we find the increase in reverberation lag is best described by an increase in the X-ray coronal height. This result, along with the finding that the corona contracts in the hard state, suggests a close relationship between spatial extent of the X-ray corona and the radio jet. We find the corona expansion (as probed by reverberation) precedes a radio flare by ∼5 days, which may suggest that the hard-to-soft transition is marked by the corona expanding vertically and launching a jet knot that propagates along the jet stream at relativistic velocities.},

	abstract = {Accreting, stellar-mass black holes are anything but predictable. A new study explores whats happening as these feeding monsters erupt in violent outbursts and then settle down again.This illustration shows some of the possible transient behavior of the gas flowing onto and away from a black hole in an X-ray binary. [NASA/JPL-Caltech]An Unsteady ExistenceBlack hole X-ray binaries (BHXBs) consist of a stellar-mass black hole that siphons material from an ordinary companion star. As this material flows between the objects, it forms an accretion disk around the black hole. BHXBs shine in X-rays from the hot material of this disk, and from a mysterious corona ultra-hot gas that exists in some unknown form above the disk.BHXBs may accrete quietly and steadily much of the time, but on occasion, they undergo sudden outbursts, substantially brightening in X-rays. Unlike supermassive black holes, which evolve on extremely long timescales, stellar-mass black holes can change over just days or weeks short enough for us to watch!In a new study led by Jingyi Wang (MIT Kavli Institute), a team of scientists presents observations by NICER an X-ray telescope installed on the International Space Station of a BHXB throwing such a temper tantrum.Reflections of a TransitionDuring an outburst, a BHXB undergoes state transitions, displaying changes in the X-ray luminosities and energies as either the corona or the disk takes over to dominate the emission. In addition to the X-ray changes, persistent radio emission from a slow and steady jet can be suddenly replaced by a short-lived radio flare that then subsides.Despite many observations, we lack the details of whats happening on small scales, close around the black hole. What form does the corona take? Does its size or extent change over time? What drives the state transitions? And how are the different components of this system disk, corona, and jet related, if at all?The top plot (a) shows the inferred corona height (black line) over the span of the outburst. The radio emission, including the flare, can be seen in red. The bottom two diagrams show the authors picture of the geometry of the black hole, disk, and corona at two points during the state changes: during the rise from quiescence (b), and at the end of the outburst when the jet base is ejected (c). Click to enlarge. [Adapted from Wang et al. 2021]Wang and collaborators used NICER data of the BHXB system MAXI J1820+070 during a 2018 outburst to track the lag caused by light travel time between X-rays that arrived directly from the corona and light from the corona that was reflected by the disk before reaching us. By modeling the changes in this reverberation lag as the system underwent state transitions, the team could infer the geometry on the small scales we cant observe, helping us to understand the tantrum.A Connected PictureWang and collaborators show that the best explanation of NICERs observations is that the height of the X-ray corona changes during the BHXBs state transitions. They argue that the corona first contracts, and then rapidly expands during the outburst, preceding a radio flare by {\textasciitilde}5 days.Under the authors interpretation, these signs point to a neat picture of BHXB outbursts: a quietly accreting black hole has a disk and a steady jet, and the corona makes up the base of that jet. When the BHXB goes into outburst, it ejects that jet base as a bright knot in its final moments of outburst, before fading back to quiescence.While this model isnt yet definitive, this latest evidence points to a clear connection between the disk, jet, and corona of a BHXB.

	abstract = {Ray tracing codes are useful to study the electromagnetic wave propagation and absorption in the geometrical optics approximation. In magnetized fusion plasma community, most ray tracing codes assume the plasma density and temperature be functions of the magnetic flux and study waves only inside the last closed flux surface, which are sufficient for the present day tokamak. However, they are difficult to be used for configurations with open magnetic field line plasmas, such as mirror machine and field-reversed-configuration (FRC). We develop a ray tracing code in cylindrical coordinates (r , ϕ , z) to support arbitrary axisymmetric configurations with both closed and open field lines plasmas. For wave propagation, the cold plasma dispersion relation is usually sufficient, and we require the magnetic field B (r , z) and species densities ns0 (r , z) profiles as input. For wave absorption, we require a further temperature Ts0 (r , z) profile to solve a hot kinetic plasma dispersion relation. In difference to other ray tracing codes which calculate the imaginary part of wave vector k⊥,i for wave absorption, we calculate the imaginary part of wave frequency ωi, which is shown to be equivalent with the former technique under weak damping approximation. The code can use either numerical or analytical equilibrium. Examples and benchmarks with electron cyclotron wave, lower hybrid wave and ion cyclotron wave for tokamak, spherical tokamak (ST), FRC and mirror machine are shown.},

	abstract = {Light bending by the strong gravity around the black hole will form the so-called black hole shadow, the shape of which can shed light on the structure of the near-horizon geometry to possibly reveal novel physics of strong gravity and black hole. In this work, we adopt both analytical and ray-tracing methods to study the black hole shadow in the presence of the infrared structure of gravity theory, which manifests the asymptotic symmetries of spacetime as the supertranslation soft hairs of the black hole. Though the black hole metrics with and without the soft hair are related by large gauge transformations, the near horizon geometries relevant for the shape of the shadow are quite different. Moreover, the Hamiltonian for the geodesic seems intrinsically different, i.e., the loss of separability due to the breaking of spherical symmetry by soft hair. By applying ray-tracing computations, we find that the soft hair, although not affecting the shape of the shadow, may change the average size and position of the shadow. Images resulting from soft hair black holes with surrounding accretion flows are also discussed.},

Astrid statistically models BH gas accretion and active galactic nucleus (AGN) feedback to their environments, applies a power-law distribution for BH seed mass \${\textbackslash}, M\_\{{\textbackslash}rm sd\}\$, uses a dynamical friction model for BH dynamics, and executes a physical treatment of BH mergers. The BH population is broadly consistent with empirical constraints on the BH mass function, the bright end of the luminosity functions, and the time evolution of BH mass and accretion rate density. The BH mass and accretion exhibit a tight correlation with host stellar mass and star formation rate. We trace BHs seeded before z {\textgreater} 10 down to z = 3, finding that BHs carry virtually no imprint of the initial \${\textbackslash}, M\_\{{\textbackslash}rm sd\}\$ except those with the smallest \${\textbackslash}, M\_\{{\textbackslash}rm sd\}\$, where less than 50 per cent of them have doubled in mass. Gas accretion is the dominant channel for BH growth compared to BH mergers. With dynamical friction, Astrid predicts a significant delay for BH mergers after the first encounter of a BH pair, with a typical elapse time of about 200 Myr. There are in total 4.5 × 105 BH mergers in Astrid at z {\textgreater} 3, {\textasciitilde}103 of which have X-ray detectable EM counterparts: a bright \${\textbackslash}, \{{\textbackslash}rm kpc\}\$ scale dual AGN with LX {\textgreater} 1043 erg s-1.

The goal of the CAMELS project is to provide theory predictions for diﬀerent observables as a function of cosmology and astrophysics, and it is the largest suite of cosmological (magneto-)hydrodynamic simulations designed to train machine learning algorithms. CAMELS contains thousands of diﬀerent cosmological and astrophysical models by way of varying Ωm, σ8, and four parameters controlling stellar and AGN feedback, following the evolution of more than 100 billion particles and ﬂuid elements over a combined volume of (400 h−1Mpc)3. We describe the simulations in detail and characterize the large range of conditions represented in terms of the matter power spectrum, cosmic star-formation rate density, galaxy stellar mass function, halo baryon fractions, and several galaxy scaling relations. We show that the IllustrisTNG and SIMBA suites produce roughly similar distributions of galaxy properties over the full parameter space but signiﬁcantly diﬀerent halo baryon fractions and baryonic eﬀects on the matter power spectrum. This emphasizes the need for marginalizing over baryonic eﬀects to extract the maximum amount of information from cosmological surveys.

We investigate these emission lines under a framework of Riemannian geometrical optics where the corona has a refractive index of n = 1. The empty space outside is a vacuum with n = 1. The Kerr metric is modiﬁed to trace the light rays that are bent due to not only the gravity of the black hole, but also the eﬀects of coronal plasma dependent on n. The choice of n alters the null geodesics, producing the eﬀect which is analogous to the light deﬂection. For the corona with n {\textgreater} 1, the disc on the far side within the corona covers a larger area on the observer’s sky, enhancing the blue wing of the line and producing more ﬂux diﬀerence between the blue peak and extended red tail. The inverse eﬀects are seen when n {\textless} 1. Moreover, the corona with n {\textgreater} 1 and n {\textless} 1 could induce extra shifts in the blue wing (∆gmax) to higher and lower energy, respectively. These eﬀects are more prominent when the inclination angle is 60◦ and the corona extends to 5rg. To obtain the deviation of the line shift of ∆gmax 0.01, the diﬀerence between the refractive index of the corona and that of the empty space must be ∆n 0.5\%.

	abstract = {The X-ray emission from active galactic nuclei (AGN) is highly variable. Measurements of time lags (characterized by lag spectra) between variability in the light curves in energy bands corresponding to directly observed continuum emission from the corona around the black hole and to X-rays reflected from the accretion disc add a further dimension to studies of the structure and energetics of these systems. We seek to understand these measurements in terms of the physical parameters of the X-ray source (its location, extent, etc.) through the calculation of theoretical lag spectra for a range of source parameters in general relativistic ray-tracing simulations, combined with the knowledge of the observed variability of the X-ray emission from AGN. Due to the proximity of the emission to the central black hole, Shapiro delays are important and the effects of general relativity should be considered when interpreting the lags as the light travel time between the source and reflector. We show that it is important to consider dilution of the lag by the contribution of both the primary and the reflected spectral components to the observed energy bands rather than observing pure continuum and reflected emission, reducing the measured lag by up to 75 per cent compared to the ‘intrinsic’ time lag due to light travel times. We find that the observed lag spectrum of the narrow-line Seyfert 1 galaxy 1H 0707−495 implies an X-ray source extending radially outwards to around 35rg and at a height of around 2rg above the plane of the accretion disc, consistent with the constraints obtained independently by considering the emissivity profile of the accretion disc. By investigating the influence of the propagation of X-ray luminosity fluctuations through the source region, we find it is possible to reproduce the shape of the low-frequency part of the lag spectrum (where the hard ‘primary’ band lags behind the soft ‘reflected’ band) as the effect of luminosity fluctuations originating in the centre of the X-ray source, close to the black hole, and propagating outwards.},

We used XMM-Newton and simultaneous Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer (RXTE) observations to obtain broadband energy coverage of both the disk and the hard X-ray Comptonization components. In most cases the detection of reverberation lags is hampered by low levels of variability-power signal-to-noise ratio (typically when the source is in a soft state) and/or short exposure times. The most detailed study was possible for GX 339-4 in the hard state, which allowed us to characterize the evolution of X-ray lags as a function of luminosity in a single source. Over all the sampled frequencies (∼0.05–9 Hz), we observe the hard lags intrinsic to the power-law component, already well known from previous RXTE studies. The XMM-Newton soft X-ray response allows us to detail the disk variability. At low frequencies (long timescales) the disk component always leads the power-law component. On the other hand, a soft reverberation lag (ascribable to thermal reprocessing) is always detected at high frequencies (short timescales). The intrinsic amplitude of the reverberation lag decreases as the source luminosity and the disk fraction increase. This suggests that the distance between the X-ray source and the region of the optically thick disk where reprocessing occurs gradually decreases as GX 339-4 rises in luminosity through the hard state, possibly as a consequence of reduced disk truncation.},

	abstract = {Surrogate neural network-based models have been lately trained and used in a variety of science and engineering applications where the number of evaluations of a target function is limited by execution time. In cell phone camera systems, various errors, such as interferences at the lens-barrel and lens-lens interfaces and axial, radial, and tilt misalignments, accumulate and alter profile of the lenses in a stochastic manner which ultimately changes optical focusing properties. Nonlinear finite element analysis of the stochastic mechanical behavior of lenses due to the interference fits is used on high-performance computing (HPC) to generate sufficient training and testing data for subsequent deep learning. Once properly trained and validated, the surrogate neural network model enabled accurate and almost instant evaluations of millions of function evaluations providing the final lens profiles. This computational model, enhanced by artificial intelligence, enabled us to efficiently perform Monte-Carlo analysis for sensitivity and uncertainty quantification of the final lens profile to various interferences. It can be further coupled with an optical analysis to perform ray tracing and analyze the focal properties of the lens module. Moreover, it can provide a valuable tool for optimizing tolerance design and intelligent components matching for many similar press-fit assembly processes.},

	abstract = {General-relativistic radiative transfer (GRRT) calculations coupled with the calculation of geodesics in the Kerr spacetime are an essential tool for determining the images, spectra and light curves from matter in the vicinity of black holes. Such studies are especially important for ongoing and upcoming millimeter/submillimeter (mm/sub-mm) Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI) observations of the supermassive black holes at the centres of Sgr A∗ and M87. To this end we introduce Odyssey, a Graphics Processing Unit (GPU)-based code for ray tracing and radiative transfer in the Kerr spacetime. On a single GPU, the performance of Odyssey can exceed 1 nanosecond per photon, per Runge-Kutta integration step. Odyssey is publicly available, fast, accurate, and ﬂexible enough to be modiﬁed to suit the speciﬁc needs of new users. Along with a Graphical User Interface (GUI) powered by a video-accelerated display architecture, we also present an educational software tool, Odyssey Edu, for showing in real time how null geodesics around a Kerr black hole vary as a function of black hole spin and angle of incidence onto the black hole.},

	abstract = {The Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) is taking the ﬁrst images of black holes resolved at horizon scales to measure their shadows and probe accretion physics. A promising avenue for testing the hypothesis that astrophysical black holes are described by the Kerr solution to Einstein’s equations is to compare the size and shape of the shadow a black hole casts on the surrounding emission to the predictions of the Kerr metric. We develop here an efﬁcient parametric framework to perform this test. We carry out ray-tracing simulations for several parameterized non-Kerr metrics to create a large data set of non-Kerr shadows that probe the allowed parameter space for the free parameters of each metric. We then perform principal components analysis (PCA) on this set of shadows and show that only a small number of components are needed to accurately reconstruct all shadows within the set. We further show that the amplitude of the PCA components are smoothly related to the free parameters in the metrics and, therefore, that these PCA components can be ﬁt to EHT observations in order to place constraints on the free parameters of these metrics that will help quantify any potential deviations from the Kerr solution.},

	abstract = {Thermal-dominated X-ray spectra of neutron stars in quiescent, transient X-ray binaries and neutron stars that undergo thermonuclear bursts are sensitive to mass and radius. The mass–radius relation of neutron stars depends on the equation of state (EoS) that governs their interior. Constraining this relation accurately is therefore of fundamental importance to understand the nature of dense matter. In this context, we introduce a pipeline to calculate realistic model spectra of rotating neutron stars with hydrogen and helium atmospheres. An arbitrarily fast-rotating neutron star with a given EoS generates the spacetime in which the atmosphere emits radiation. We use the LORENE/NROTSTAR code to compute the spacetime numerically and the ATM24 code to solve the radiative transfer equations self-consistently. Emerging speciﬁc intensity spectra are then ray-traced through the neutron star’s spacetime from the atmosphere to a distant observer with the GYOTO code. Here, we present and test our fully relativistic numerical pipeline. To discuss and illustrate the importance of realistic atmosphere models, we compare our model spectra to simpler models like the commonly used isotropic color-corrected blackbody emission. We highlight the importance of considering realistic model-atmosphere spectra together with relativistic ray-tracing to obtain accurate predictions. We also insist upon the crucial impact of the star’s rotation on the observables. Finally, we close a controversy that has been ongoing in the literature in the recent years, regarding the validity of the ATM24 code.},

We present ARCMANCER, a publicly available general ray-tracing and tensor algebra library, written in C++ and providing a Python interface. ARCMANCER supports Riemannian and semi-Riemannian spaces of any dimension and metric, and has novel features such as support for multiple simultaneous coordinate charts, embedded geometric shapes, local coordinate systems, and automatic parallel propagation. The ARCMANCER interface is extensively documented and user friendly. While these capabilities make the library well suited for a large variety of problems in numerical geometry, the main focus of this paper is in general relativistic polarized radiative transfer. The accuracy of the code is demonstrated in several code tests and in a comparison with GRTRANS, an existing ray-tracing code. We then use the library in several scenarios as a way to showcase the wide applicability of the code. We study a thin variable-geometry accretion disk model and find that polarization carries information of the inner disk opening angle. Next, we study rotating neutron stars and determine that to obtain polarized light curves at better than a ∼ 1 \% level of accuracy, the rotation needs to be taken into account both in the spacetime metric and in the shape of the star. Finally, we investigate the observational signatures of an accreting black hole lensed by an orbiting black hole. We find that these systems exhibit a characteristic asymmetric twin-peak profile both in flux and polarization properties.},

In particular, the extreme case of a black hole where the curvature becomes so strong that even light cannot escape, benefits from an interactive visualization where students can investigate the distortion effects by moving objects around. However, the most commonly used technique of four-dimensional general-relativistic ray tracing is still too slow for interactive frame rates. Therefore, we propose an efficient and adaptive polygon rendering method that takes light deflection and light travel time into account. An additional advantage of this method is that it provides a natural demonstration of how multiple images occur and how light travel time affects them. Finally, we present our method using three example scenes: a triangle passing behind a black hole, a sphere orbiting a black hole and an accretion disk with different inclination angles.},

of the reprocessing of corona photons by the underlying accretion disk,

raytracing in the Kerr metric, with the disk thickness almost
ubiquitously assumed to be negligible (“razor thin”) and the
corona commonly approximated as a point source located along the polar

Fenrir, to explore the effect that accretion disk geometry has on
reverberation signatures, assuming a lamppost configuration but allowing
for a finite disk scale height. We characterize the signatures of finite
disk thickness in the reverberation transfer function and calculate how
they might manifest in observed lag-frequency spectra. We also show that
a disk-hugging corona (approximated by off-axis point-like flares)
exhibits characteristics that are qualitatively different from
observation, thus providing further evidence for a flaring corona that
is separated from the underlying disk material.},

	abstract = {Inferring representations of 3D scenes from 2D observations is a fundamental problem of computer graphics, computer vision, and artificial intelligence. Emerging 3D-structured neural scene representations are a promising approach to 3D scene understanding. In this work, we propose a novel neural scene representation, Light Field Networks or LFNs, which represent both geometry and appearance of the underlying 3D scene in a 360-degree, four-dimensional light field parameterized via a neural implicit representation. Rendering a ray from an LFN requires only a single network evaluation, as opposed to hundreds of evaluations per ray for ray-marching or volumetric based renderers in 3D-structured neural scene representations. In the setting of simple scenes, we leverage meta-learning to learn a prior over LFNs that enables multi-view consistent light field reconstruction from as little as a single image observation. This results in dramatic reductions in time and memory complexity, and enables real-time rendering. The cost of storing a 360-degree light field via an LFN is two orders of magnitude lower than conventional methods such as the Lumigraph. Utilizing the analytical differentiability of neural implicit representations and a novel parameterization of light space, we further demonstrate the extraction of sparse depth maps from LFNs.},

	abstract = {(Abridged) We here continue our effort to model the behaviour of matter when orbiting or accreting onto a generic black hole by developing a new numerical code employing advanced techniques geared solve the equations of in general-relativistic hydrodynamics. The new code employs a number of high-resolution shock-capturing Riemann-solvers and reconstruction algorithms, exploiting the enhanced accuracy and the reduced computational cost of AMR techniques. In addition, the code makes use of sophisticated ray-tracing libraries that, coupled with general-relativistic radiation-transfer calculations, allow us to compute accurately the electromagnetic emissions from such accretion flows. We validate the new code by presenting an extensive series of stationary accretion flows either in spherical or axial symmetry and performed either in 2D or 3D. In addition, we consider the highly nonlinear scenario of a recoiling black hole produced in the merger of a supermassive black hole binary interacting with the surrounding circumbinary disc. In this way we can present, for the first time, ray-traced images of the shocked fluid and the light-curve resulting from consistent general-relativistic radiation-transport calculations from this process. The work presented here lays the ground for the development of a generic computational infrastructure employing AMR techniques to deal accurately and self-consistently with accretion flows onto compact objects. In addition to the accurate handling of the matter, we provide a self-consistent electromagnetic emission from these scenarios by solving the associated radiative-transfer problem. While magnetic fields are presently excluded from our analysis, the tools presented here can have a number of applications to study accretion flows onto black holes or neutron stars.},

	abstract = {Accretion on to compact objects plays a central role in high-energy astrophysics. In these environments, both general relativistic and plasma effects may have significant impacts upon the spectral and polarimetric properties of the accretion flow. In Paper I we presented a fully general relativistic magnetoionic theory, capable of tracing rays in the geometric optics approximation through a magnetized plasma in the vicinity of a compact object. In this paper we discuss how to perform polarized radiative transfer along these rays. In addition we apply the formalism to a barotropic thick-disc model, appropriate for low-luminosity active galactic nuclei. We find that, when the observation frequency is near the plasma and cyclotron frequencies in the innermost portions of the accretion flow, it is possible to generate large fractional polarizations, even when the emission mechanism is unpolarized. This has implications for accreting systems ranging from pulsars and X-ray binaries to active galactic nuclei.},

	abstract = {Recent advances in general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic simulations have expanded and improved our understanding of the dynamics of black-hole accretion disks. However, current simulations do not capture the thermodynamics of electrons in the low density accreting plasma. This poses a significant challenge in predicting accretion flow images and spectra from first principles. Because of this, simplified emission models have often been used, with widely different configurations (e.g., disk- versus jet-dominated emission), and were able to account for the observed spectral properties of accreting black holes. Exploring the large parameter space introduced by such models, however, requires significant computational power that exceeds conventional computational facilities. In this paper, we use GRay, a fast graphics processing unit (GPU) based ray-tracing algorithm, on the GPU cluster El Gato, to compute images and spectra for a set of six general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic simulations with different magnetic field configurations and black-hole spins. We also employ two different parametric models for the plasma thermodynamics in each of the simulations. We show that, if only the spectral properties of Sgr A* are used, all 12 models tested here can fit the spectra equally well. However, when combined with the measurement of the image size of the emission using the Event Horizon Telescope, current observations rule out all models with strong funnel emission, because the funnels are typically very extended. Our study shows that images of accretion flows with horizon-scale resolution offer a powerful tool in understanding accretion flows around black holes and their thermodynamic properties.},

This graphics-processing-unit (GPU)-based integrator employs the stream processing paradigm, is implemented in CUDA C/C++, and runs on nVidia graphics cards. The peak performance of GRay using single-precision floating-point arithmetic on a single GPU exceeds 300 GFLOP (or 1 ns per photon per time step). For a realistic problem, where the peak performance cannot be reached, GRay is two orders of magnitude faster than existing central-processing-unit-based ray-tracing codes. This performance enhancement allows more effective searches of large parameter spaces when comparing theoretical predictions of images, spectra, and light curves from the vicinities of compact objects to observations. GRay can also perform on-the-fly ray tracing within general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic algorithms that simulate accretion flows around compact objects. Making use of this algorithm, we calculate the properties of the shadows of Kerr black holes and the photon rings that surround them. We also provide accurate fitting formulae of their dependencies on black hole spin and observer inclination, which can be used to interpret upcoming observations of the black holes at the center of the Milky Way, as well as M87, with the Event Horizon Telescope.},

	abstract = {We analyze two 3D general-relativistic magnetohydrodynamic accretion simulations in the context of how they would manifest in Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) observations of supermassive black holes. The two simulations differ only in whether the initial angular momentum of the plasma is aligned with the rapid (a = 0.9) spin of the black hole. Both have low net magnetic flux. Ray tracing is employed to generate resolved images of the synchrotron emission. When using parameters appropriate for Sgr A* and assuming a viewing angle aligned with the black hole spin, we find the most prominent difference is that the central shadow in the image is noticeably eccentric in tilted models, with the ring of emission relatively unchanged. Applying this procedure to M87 with a viewing angle based on the large-scale jet, we find that adding tilt increases the angular size of the ring for fixed black hole mass and distance, while at the same time increasing the number of bright spots in the image. Our findings illustrate observable features that can distinguish tilted from aligned flows. They also show that tilted models can be viable for M87, and that not accounting for tilt can bias inferences of physical parameters. Future modeling of horizon-scale observations should account for potential angular momentum misalignment, which is likely generic at the low accretion rates appropriate for EHT targets.},

Comparing the EHT observed image with images based on numerical simulations of BH accretion flows suggests that on average the projected BH spin axis should be oriented SSW {\textbackslash}citep\{2019ApJ...875L...5E\}. Alternatively, if the spin axis is matched with the jet direction, emission from the SEE sector of the photon ring can only be accounted for as a temporary fluctuation. We explore highly simplified toy models for geometric distribution and kinematics of emitting regions in the Kerr metric, and perform ray tracing to calculate images. We strictly assume that: (1) the BH spin vector is fixed to the jet axis (position angle \$\{{\textbackslash}rm PA\}\_\{{\textbackslash}rm jet\} = 288{\textasciicircum}{\textbackslash}circ\$, inclination \$i = 162{\textasciicircum}{\textbackslash}circ\$), (2) the emitting regions are stationary and symmetric with respect to the BH spin, (3) the emissivities are isotropic in the local rest frames. Emission from the crescent sector SSE - SWW can be readily explained in terms of an equatorial ring with either circular or plunging geodesic flows, regardless of the value of BH spin. In the case of plane-symmetric polar caps with plunging geodesic flows, the dominant image of the cap located behind the BH is sensitive to the angular momentum of the emitter. Within the constraints of our model, we have not found a viable explanation for the observed brightness of the SEE sector. We conclude that the SEE emission should indeed be interpreted as a temporary departure from intrinsic axial symmetry of the inner accretion flow.},

	abstract = {We present a formulation for a local cooling function to be employed in the diffuse, hot corona region of 3D GRMHD simulations of accreting black holes. This new cooling function calculates the cooling rate due to inverse Compton scattering by considering the relevant microphysics in each cell in the corona and approximating the radiation energy density and Compton temperature thereby integrating over the thermal seed photon flux from the disk surface. The method either assumes the ion and electron temperatures are equal (1T) or calculates them separately (2T) using an instantaneous equilibrium approach predicated on the actual relevant rate equations (Coulomb and Compton). The method is shown to be consistent with a more detailed ray-tracing calculation where the bulk of the cooling occurs, but is substantially less costly to perform. As an example, we apply these methods to a HARM3D simulation of a 10M⊙, non-spinning black hole, accreting at nominally 1\% the Eddington value. This new approach leads to radiative efficiency values ≃65\% above Novikov-Thorne, with a larger fraction of total cooling in the corona as compared to simulations performed using the original target-temperature cooling function. Time-averaged post-processing reveals that the continuum spectral observations predicted from these simulations are qualitatively similar to actual X-ray binary data, especially so for the 1T approach, which yields a harder power-law component (Γ = 2.25) compared to the 2T version (Γ = 2.53).},

	abstract = {Emission from an accretion disc around compact objects, such as neutron stars and black holes, is expected to be significantly polarized. The polarization can be used to put constraints on geometrical and physical parameters of the compact sources -- their radii, masses and spins -- as well as to determine the orbital parameters. The radiation escaping from the innermost parts of the disc is strongly affected by the gravitational field of the compact object and relativistic velocities of the matter. The straightforward calculation of the observed polarization signatures involves computationally expensive ray-tracing technique. At the same time, having fast computational routines for direct data fitting becomes increasingly important in light of the currently observed images of the accretion flow around supermassive black hole in M87 by the Event Horizon Telescope, infrared polarization signatures coming from Sgr A*, as well as for the upcoming X-ray polarization measurements by the Imaging X-ray Polarimetry Explorer and enhanced X-ray Timing and Polarimetry mission. In this work, we obtain an exact analytical expression for the rotation angle of polarization plane in Schwarzschild metric accounting for the effects of light bending and relativistic aberration. We show that the calculation of the observed flux, polarization degree and polarization angle as a function of energy can be performed analytically with high accuracy using approximate light-bending formula, lifting the need for the pre-computed tabular models in fitting routines.},

	abstract = {X-ray reverberation has become a powerful tool to probe the disc-corona geometry near black holes. Here, we develop machine learning (ML) models to extract the X-ray reverberation features imprinted in the power spectral density (PSD) of active galactic nucleus (AGN). The machine is trained using simulated PSDs in the form of a simple power-law encoded with the relativistic echo features. Dictionary learning and sparse coding algorithms are used for the PSD reconstruction, by transforming the noisy PSD to a representative sparse version. Then, the support vector machine is employed to extract the interpretable reverberation features from the reconstructed PSD that holds the information of the source height. The results show that the accuracy of predicting the source height, h, is genuinely high and the misclassiﬁcation is only found when h {\textgreater} 15rg. When the test PSD has a bending power-law shape, which is completely new to the machine, the accuracy is still high. Therefore, the ML model does not require the intrinsic shape of the PSD to be determined in advance. By focusing on the PSD parameter space observed in real AGN data, classiﬁcation for h ≤ 10rg can be determined with 100 per cent accuracy, even using a PSD in an energy band that contains a reﬂection ﬂux as low as 10 per cent of the total ﬂux. For h {\textgreater} 10rg, the data, if misclassiﬁed, will have small uncertainties of h ∼ 2–4rg. This work shows, as a proof of concept, that the ML technique could shape new methodological directions in the X-ray reverberation analysis.},

This model consists of two axial point sources illuminating an accretion disc that produce the reverberation lags. These lags are due to the time delays between the directly observed and reflection photons and are associated with the light-travel time between the source and the disc, so they allow us to probe the disc-corona geometry. We assume the variations of two X-ray sources are triggered by the same primary variations, but allow the two sources to respond in different ways (I.e. having
different source responses). The variations of each source induce a delayed accretion disc response and the total lags consist of a
combination of both source and disc responses. We show that the extended corona model can reproduce both the low-frequency hard and
high-frequency soft (reverberation) lags. Fitting the model to the timing data of PG 1244+026 reveals the hard and soft X-ray sources at ∼6rg and ∼11rg, respectively. The upper
source produces small amounts of reflection and can be interpreted as a relativistic jet, or outflowing blob, whose emission is beamed away from the disc. This explains the observed lag energy in which there is no soft lag at energies {\textless}1 keV as they are diluted by the soft continuum of the upper source. Finally, our models suggest that the fluctuations propagating between the two sources of PG 1244+026 are possible but only at near the speed of light.},

Reverberation lags between correlated variability in the directly observed continuum emission and that reﬂected from the accretion disc arise due to the additional light travel time between the corona and reﬂecting disc. X-ray reverberation is detected from an increasing sample of Seyfert galaxies and a number of common properties are observed, including a transition from the characteristic reverberation signature at high frequencies to a hard lag within the continuum component at low frequencies, as well a pronounced dip in the reverberation lag at 3 keV. These features are not trivially explained by the reverberation of X-rays originating from simple point sources. We therefore model reverberation from coronæ extended both over the surface of the disc and vertically. Causal propagation through its extent for both the simple case of constant velocity propagation and propagation linked to the viscous timescale in the underlying accretion disc is included as well as stochastic variability arising due to turbulence locally on the disc. We ﬁnd that the observed features of X-ray reverberation in Seyfert galaxies can be explained if the long timescale variability is dominated by the viscous propagation of ﬂuctuations through the corona. The corona extends radially at low height over the surface of the disc but with a bright central region in which ﬂuctuations propagate up the black hole rotation axis driven by more rapid variability arising from the innermost regions of the accretion ﬂow.},

	abstract = {X-ray reverberation is a powerful technique that uses the echoes of the coronal emission reflected by a black hole (BH) accretion disk to map out the inner disk structure. While the theory of X-ray reverberation has been developed almost exclusively for standard thin disks, reverberation lags have recently been observed from likely super-Eddington accretion sources such as the jetted tidal disruption event Swift J1644+57. In this paper, we extend X-ray reverberation studies into the regime of super-Eddington accretion with a focus on investigating the lags in the fluorescent Fe Kα line region. We find that the coronal photons are mostly reflected by the fast and optically thick winds launched from the super-Eddington accretion flow, and this funnel-like reflection geometry produces lag-frequency and lag-energy spectra with unique observable characteristics. The lag-frequency spectrum exhibits a step-function-like decline near the first zero-crossing point. As a result, the magnitude of the lag scales linearly with the BH mass for a large parameter space, and the shape of the lag-energy spectrum remains almost independent of the choice of frequency bands. Not only can these features be used to distinguish super-Eddington accretion systems from sub-Eddington systems, but they are also key for constraining the reflection geometry and extracting parameters from the observed lags. When fitting the observed reverberation lag of Swift J1644+57 to our modeling, we find that the super-Eddington disk geometry is slightly preferred over the thin disk geometry, and we obtain a BH mass of 5-6 × 106 M ⊙ and a coronal height around 10 Rg .},

	abstract = {Warm coronae, thick (τT = 10-20, where τT is the Thomson depth) Comptonizing regions with temperatures of ∼1 keV, are proposed to exist at the surfaces of accretion discs in active galactic nuclei (AGNs). By combining with the reflection spectrum, warm coronae may be responsible for producing the smooth soft excess seen in AGN X-ray spectra. This paper studies how a warm corona must adjust in order to sustain the soft excess through large changes in the AGN flux. Spectra from one-dimensional constant density and hydrostatic warm corona models are calculated assuming that the illuminating hard X-ray power law, gas density, Thomson depth, and coronal heating strength vary in response to changes in the accretion rate. We identify models that produce warm coronae with temperatures between 0.3 and 1.1 keV, and measure the photon indices and emitted fluxes in the 0.5-2 and 2-10 keV bands. Correlations and anticorrelations between these quantities depend on the evolution and structure of the warm corona. Tracing the path that an AGN follows through these correlations will constrain how warm coronae are heated and connected to the accretion disc. Variations in the density structure and coronal heating strength of warm coronae will lead to a variety of soft excess strengths and shapes in AGNs. A larger accretion rate will, on average, lead to a warm corona that produces a stronger soft excess, consistent with observations of local Seyfert galaxies.},

The formulation takes full account of relativistic eﬀects in the photon transport and the relative motions of the emitters and the light-of-sight absorbing material. We apply the formulation to calculate the emission from accretion disks and tori around rotating black holes. In our model the emission lines and continuum originate from an accretion disk or torus, and the motion of the emitters in the disk/torus is determined by the gravity of the black hole and the spacetime structure near the black hole. The line-of-sight absorbing medium is comprised of cold absorbing cloudlets. These cloudlets are kinematically hot, with their velocity dispersion determined by the local virial temperature. The emission from the accretion disk/torus is resonantly absorbed/scattered. Our calculations demonstrate that line-of-sight absorption signiﬁcantly modiﬁes the proﬁles of lines from the accretion disks. It is often diﬃcult to disentangle absorption eﬀects from other geometrical and kinematics eﬀects, such as the viewing inclination and the spin of the black hole. Our calculations also show that emission lines from accretion tori and from thin accretion disks diﬀer substantially. Large geometrical obscuration could occur in tori, and as a consequence lines from tori generally have much weaker redshift wings at large viewing inclination angles. Moreover, the blue peak is truncated.},

The evolution of these transient sources is complex. Nevertheless, there are behavior patterns common to all of them as we show in a comprehensive comparison of six selected systems. Central to this comparison are three X-ray states of accretion, which are reviewed and defined quantitatively. We discuss phenomena that arise in strong gravitational fields, including relativistically-broadened Fe lines, high-frequency quasi-periodic oscillations (100 450 Hz), and relativistic radio and X-ray jets. Such phenomena show us how a black hole interacts with its environment, thereby complementing the picture of black holes that gravitational wave detectors will provide.

Equations governing stationary force-free electromagnetic fields in Kerr spacetime are derived, and it is found that energy and angular momentum can be extracted from a rotating black hole by a purely electromagnetic mechanism. A perturbation technique is outlined for calculating approximate solutions under certain circumstances, and solutions are obtained for a split monopole magnetic field as well as for a paraboloidal magnetic field.

The structure and radiation spectrum of the disk depend, mainly on the rate of matter inflow A into the disk at its external boundary The dependence on the efficiency of mechanisms of angular momentum transport (connected with the magnetic field and turbulence) is weaker. If A = 1O- 3.1O-8 M0 the disk around the black hole is a year powerful source of X-ray radiation with hv 1- 10 keV and luminosity L 1O - 1038 erg/s. If the flux of the accreting matter decreases, the effective temperature of the radiation and the luminosity will drop. On the other hand, when M \&gt; 1O- M0 the optical luminosity year of the disk exceeds the solar value. The main contribution to the optical luminosity of the black hole arises from reradiation of that part of the X-ray and ultra-violet energy which is initially produced in the central high temperature regions of the disk and which is then absorbed by the low temperature outer regions. saturated by broad recombination and resonance emission lines. Variability, connected with the character of the motion of the black hole, with gas flows in a binary system and with eclipses, is possible. Under certain conditions, the hard radiation can evaporate the gas. This can counteract the matter inflow into the disk and lead to autoregulation of the accretion. If M 3. 10-8M0 the luminosity of the disk around year the black hole is stabilized at the critical level of L 1038 M erg A small fraction of the accreting M0 s matter falls under the gravitational radius whereas the major part of it flows out with high velocity from the central regions of the disk. The outfiowing matter is opaque to the disk radiation and completely transforms its spectrum.

	abstract = {Methods. We used all available archival XMM-Newton data for the sources in our sample and extracted light curves in the 5−7 and 2−4 keV energy bands. We used these light curves and applied a thoroughly tested (through extensive numerical simulations) recipe to estimate time-lags that have minimal bias, approximately follow a Gaussian distribution, and have known errors. Using traditional χ2 minimisation techniques, we then ﬁtted the observed time-lags with two diﬀerent models: a phenomenological model where the time-lags have a power-law dependence on frequency, and a physical model, using the reverberation time-lags expected in the lamppost geometry. The latter were computed assuming a point-like primary X-ray source above a black hole surrounded by a neutral and prograde accretion disc with solar iron abundance. We took all relativistic eﬀects into account for various X-ray source heights, inclination angles, and black hole spin values.
Results. Given the available data, time-lags between the two energy bands can only be reliably measured at frequencies between ∼5 × 10−5 Hz and ∼10−3 Hz. The power-law and reverberation time-lag models can both ﬁt the data well in terms of formal statistical characteristics. When ﬁtting the observed time-lags to the lamp-post reverberation scenario, we can only constrain the height of the X-ray source. The data require, or are consistent with, a small ({\textless}∼10 gravitational radii) X-ray source height.
Conclusions. In principle, the 5−7 keV band, which contains most of the Fe Kα line emission, could be an ideal band for studying reverberation eﬀects, as it is expected to be dominated by the X-ray reﬂection component. We here carried out the best possible analysis with XMM-Newton data. Time-lags can be reliably estimated over a relatively narrow frequency range, and their errors are rather large. Nevertheless, our results are consistent with the hypothesis of X-ray reﬂection from the inner accretion disc.},

The formulation is covariant, and transfer calculations are conducted along particle geodesics connecting the emitters and the observer. The geodesics are determined through the space-time metric, which is specified beforehand. Absorption and emission in the radiative transfer calculations are treated explicitly. The particle-medium interaction is evaluated in the local inertial frame, co-moving with the medium. Relativistic, geometrical and optical depth effects are treated self-consistently within an integral covariant framework. {\textless}i{\textgreater}Results.{\textless}i/{\textgreater} We present a self-consistent general relativistic radiative transfer formulation with explicit treatment of emission and absorption. The formulation is general and is applicable to both particles with mass and without mass. The presence of particles has two major effects: firstly the particle bundle ray is no longer along the null geodesic, and secondly the intensity variation along the particle bundle ray is reduced by an aberration factor. The radiative transfer formulation can handle 3D geometrical settings and structured objects with variations and gradients in the optical depths across the objects and along the line-of-sight. Such scenarios are applicable in calculations of photon emission from complex structured accretion flows around black holes and neutrino emission from remnant neutron tori in neutron-star mergers. We apply the formulation and demonstrate radiation transfer calculations for emission from accretion tori around rotating black holes. We consider two cases: idealised optically thick tori that have a sharply defined emission boundary surface, and structured tori that allow variations in the absorption coefficient and emissivity within the tori. We show intensity images and emission spectra of the tori obtained in our calculations. Our findings in the radiative transfer calculations are summarised as follows. (i) Geometrical effects, such as lensing-induced self-occulation and multiple-image contribution are much more significant in accretion tori than geometrically thin accretion disks. (ii) Optically thin accretion tori show emission line profiles distinguishable from the profiles of lines from optically thick accretion tori and lines from optically thick geometrically thin accretion disks. (iii) The line profiles of the optically thin accretion tori have a weaker dependence on the viewing inclination angle than those of the optically thick accretion tori or accretion disks, especially at high viewing inclination angles. (iv) Limb effects are present in accretion tori with finite optical depths, due to density and temperature stratification within the tori. We note that in accretion flows onto relativistic compact objects, gravitationally induced line resonance can occur. This resonance occurs easily in 3D flows, but not in 2D flows, such as a thin accretion disk around a black hole.},

	abstract = {It has been thought for decades that rotating black holes (BHs) power the energetic gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) and active galactic nuclei (AGNs), but the mechanism that extracts the BH energy has remained elusive. We here show that the solution to this problem arises when the BH is immersed in an external magnetic field and ionized low-density matter. For a magnetic field parallel to the BH spin, the induced electric field accelerates electrons outward and protons inward at spherical polar angles \$-60{\textasciicircum}{\textbackslash}circ{\textbackslash}lesssim {\textbackslash}theta {\textbackslash}lesssim 60{\textasciicircum}{\textbackslash}circ\$ (hereafter polar region), and vice versa at \$60{\textasciicircum}{\textbackslash}circ{\textbackslash}lesssim {\textbackslash}theta {\textbackslash}lesssim 120{\textasciicircum}{\textbackslash}circ\$ (hereafter equatorial region). For an antiparallel magnetic field, protons and electrons exchange their roles. The particles that are accelerated outward radiate off energy and angular momentum to infinity. The BH powers the process by reducing its energy and angular momentum by capturing polar protons and equatorial electrons with net negative energy and angular momentum. The electric potential allows for negative energy states outside the BH ergosphere, so the latter does not play any role in this electrodynamical BH energy extraction process.},

Importantly, the radial profile of the scalar refractive index is finite along all trajectories except at the point of rotation reversal for counter-rotating geodesics. Construction of these analogues is feasible with available ordinary materials. A finite-difference frequency-domain solver of Maxwell's equations is used to simulate light trajectories around a variety of Kerr-Newman black holes.

The transfer functions for polar coordinates (rs, φs) in the plane are shown in Figs. 5, 6, and 9 for the n = 0, n = 1, and n = 2 images, respectively. Likewise, the time lapse ∆t between source and observer is also shown in Figs. 7 and 8 for the n = 0 and n = 1 images, respectively. The nth image always ﬁlls out the nth lensing band, as expected.},

	abstract = {MAXI J1820+070 is a transient black hole binary (BHB) discovered on 2018 March 11. The unprecedented rich statistics brought by the NICER X-ray telescope allows detailed timing analysis up to ∼1 kHz uncompromised by the photon shot noise. To estimate the time lags, the Fourier analysis was applied, which led to two diﬀerent conclusions for the system conﬁguration; one supporting the lamp-post conﬁguration with a stable accretion disk extending close to the innermost stable circular orbit and the other supporting the truncated accretion disk contracting with time. Using the same data set, we present the results based on the cross-correlation function (CCF). The CCF is calculated between two diﬀerent X-ray bands and one side is subtracted from the other side, which we call the diﬀerential CCF (dCCF). The soft and hard lags respectively of ∼0.03 and 3 s are clearly identiﬁed without being diluted by the spectral mixture, demonstrating the eﬀectiveness of the dCCF analysis. The evolution of these lags is tracked, along with spectral changes for the ﬁrst 120 days since the discovery. Both the dCCF and spectral ﬁtting results are interpreted that the soft lag is a reverberation lag between the Comptonized emission and the soft excess emission and that the hard lag is between the disk black body emission and the Comptonized emission. The evolution of these lags is in line with the picture of the truncated disk contracting with time.},

We study the critical parameters where the KNS shadow opens a gap, a distinctive phenomenon that does not happen with the black hole shadow. We show that the KNS shadow can only be closed for dimensionless spin \$a {\textbackslash}lesssim 1.18\$ and vanishing for \$a {\textbackslash}gtrsim 1.18\$ for certain ranges of inclination angles. We also perform numerical general relativistic ray tracing calculations, which reproduce the analytical topological change in the KNS shadow and illustrate other observational features within the shadow due to the lack of an event horizon. By comparing with black hole shadow observations, the topological change in the shadow of KNSs can be used to test the cosmic censorship hypothesis and KNSs as alternative models to SMBHs.},

We use the vertically averaged magnetic stress in the simulated disc as a proxy for the rest-frame dissipation, and compute the observed emission by folding this through the transfer function describing the relativistic beaming, light bending and time delays near a non-rotating black hole. The temporal power spectrum of the predicted emission from individual annuli in the disc is described by a broken power law, with indices of ≈ −3.5 at high frequency and ≈0 to −1 at low frequency. Integrated over the disc, the power spectrum is approximated by a single power law with an index of −2. Increasing inclination boosts the relative power at frequencies around ≈0.3 f ms, where f ms is the orbital frequency at the marginally stable orbit, but no evidence is found for sharp quasi-periodic oscillations in the light curve. Assuming that ﬂuorescent iron line emission locally tracks the continuum ﬂux, we compute simulated broad iron line proﬁles. We ﬁnd that relativistic beaming of the non-axisymmetric emission proﬁle, induced by turbulence, produces high-amplitude variability in the iron line proﬁle. We show that this substructure within the broad iron line proﬁle can survive averaging over a number of orbital periods, and discuss the origin of the anomalous X-ray spectral features, recently reported by Turner et al. for the Seyfert galaxy NGC 3516, in the context of turbulent disc models.},

Simulated images of black holes produced via general relativistic ray tracing and radiative transfer provide a key counterpart to these observational efforts. Black hole images have a wide range of physically interesting image structures, ranging from extremely fine scales in their lensed “photon rings” to the very large scales in their relativistic jets. The multiscale nature of the black hole system is therefore suitable for a multiscale approach to generate simulated images that capture all key elements of the system. Here, we present a prescription for adaptive ray tracing, which enables efficient computation of extremely high-resolution images of black holes. Using the polarized ray-tracing code ipole, we image a combination of semianalytic and general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic (GRMHD) models, and we show that images can be reproduced with a mean squared error of less than 0.1\% even after tracing 12× fewer rays. We then use adaptive ray tracing to explore the properties of the photon ring. We illustrate the behavior of individual subrings in GRMHD simulations, and we explore their signatures in interferometric visibilities.},

	abstract = {The illumination pattern (or emissivity profile) of the accretion disc due to the reflection of X-rays in active galactic nucleus can be understood in terms of relativistic effects on the rays propagating from a source in a corona surrounding the central black hole, both on their trajectories and on the accretion disc itself. Theoretical emissivity profiles due to isotropic point sources as well as simple extended geometries are computed in general relativistic ray-tracing simulations performed on graphics processing units (GPUs). Such simulations assuming only general relativity naturally explain the accretion disc emissivity profiles determined from relativistically broadened emission lines which fall off steeply (with power-law indices of between 6 and 8) over the inner regions of the disc, then flattening off to almost a constant before tending to a constant power law of index 3 over the outer disc. Simulations for a variety of source locations, extents and geometries show how the emissivity profiles depend on these properties, and when combined with reverberation time lags allow the location and extent of the primary X-ray source to be constrained. Comparing the emissivity profile determined from the broadened iron K emission line in spectra of 1H 0707−495 obtained in 2008 January to theoretical emissivity profiles and applying constraints from reverberation lags suggest that there exists an extended region of primary X-ray emission located as low as 2rg above the accretion disc, extending outwards to a radius of around 30rg.},

Through the analysis of various parameters of the geometries simulated it is found that emissivity profiles produced by point source and extended geometries such as cylindrical slabs and spheroidal coronae placed on the accretion disc are distinguishable. Profiles produced by point source and conical geometries are not significantly different, requiring an analysis of reflection fraction to differentiate the two geometries. Beamed point and beamed conical sources are also simulated in an effort to model jet-like coronae, though the differences here are most evident in the reflection fraction. For a point source we determine an approximation for the measured reflection fraction with the source height and velocity. Simulating spectra from the emissivity profiles produced by the various geometries produce distinguishable differences. Overall spectral differences between the geometries do not exceed 15 per cent in the most extreme cases. It is found that emissivity profiles can be useful in distinguishing point source and extended geometries given high-quality spectral data of extreme, bright sources over long exposure times. In combination with reflection fraction, timing and spectral analysis we may use emissivity profiles to discern the geometry of the X-ray source.},

Being able to directly detect the presence of the ISCO and probe the dynamics of material plunging through the event horizon represents a unique test of general relativity in the strong field regime. X-ray reverberation off of the accretion disc and material in the plunging region is modelled using general relativistic ray tracing simulations. X-ray reverberation from the plunging region has a minimal effect on the time-averaged X-ray spectrum and the overall lag-energy spectrum, but is manifested in the lag in the highest frequency Fourier components, above \$0.01{\textbackslash}, c{\textasciicircum}\{3\}{\textbackslash}, (GM){\textasciicircum}\{-1\}\$ (scaled for the mass of the black hole) in the 2-4 keV energy band for a non-spinning black hole or the 1-2 keV energy band for a maximally spinning black hole. The plunging region is distinguished from disc emission not just by the energy shifts characteristic of plunging orbits, but by the rapid increase in ionization of material through the plunging region. Detection requires measurement of time lags to an accuracy of 20 per cent at these frequencies. Improving accuracy to 12 per cent will enable constraints to be placed on the dynamics of material in the plunging region and distinguish plunging orbits from material remaining on stable circular orbits, confirming the existence of the ISCO, a prime discovery space for future X-ray missions.},

	abstract = {Multi-wavelength observations suggest that the accretion disk in the hard and intermediate states of X-ray binaries (XRBs) and active galactic nuclei (AGN) transitions from a cold, thin disk at large distances into a hot, thick flow close to the black hole. However, the formation, structure and dynamics of such truncated disks are poorly constrained due to the complexity of the thermodynamic, magnetic, and radiative processes involved. We present the first radiation-transport two-temperature general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic (GRMHD) simulations of truncated disks radiating at 35\% of the Eddington luminosity with and without large-scale poloidal magnetic flux. We demonstrate that when a geometrically-thin accretion disk is threaded by large-scale net poloidal magnetic flux, it self-consistently transitions at small radii into a two-phase medium of cold gas clumps floating through a hot, magnetically dominated corona. This transition occurs at a well-defined truncation radius determined by the distance out to which the disk is saturated with magnetic flux. The average ion and electron temperatures in the semi-opaque corona reach, respectively, Ti=10{\textasciicircum}10 K and Te=5x10{\textasciicircum}8 K. The system produces radiation, powerful collimated jets and broader winds at the total energy efficiency exceeding 90\%, the highest ever energy extraction efficiency from a spinning black hole by a radiatively efficient flow in a GRMHD simulation. This is consistent with jetted ejections observed during XRB outbursts. The two-phase medium can naturally lead to broadened iron line emission observed in the hard state.},

For a point source we determine an approximation for the measured reflection fraction with the source height and velocity. Simulating spectra from the emissivity profiles produced by the various geometries produce distinguishable differences. Overall spectral differences between the geometries do not exceed 15 per cent in the most extreme cases. It is found that emissivity profiles can be useful in distinguishing point source and extended geometries given high-quality spectral data of extreme, bright sources over long exposure times. In combination with reflection fraction, timing and spectral analysis we may use emissivity profiles to discern the geometry of the X-ray source.},

In a viscous disk, such a configuration is susceptible to the Bardeen-Petterson effect, which causes the flow to divide into two distinct regions - an inner aligned accretion disk and an outer tilted accretion disk. We propose that hydrodynamic effects at the interface between these two regions could potentially generate moderate frequency quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs) such as have been observed in the X-ray spectra of low-mass X-ray binaries (LMXBs). Here we consider inviscid flows, which demonstrate the effects of relativistic frame-dragging near the black hole.},

	abstract = {Interpretation of resolved polarized images of black holes by the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) requires predictions of the polarized emission observable by an Earth-based instrument for a particular model of the black hole accretion system. Such predictions are generated by general relativistic radiative transfer (GRRT) codes, which integrate the equations of polarized radiative transfer in curved spacetime. A selection of ray-tracing GRRT codes used within the EHT collaboration is evaluated for accuracy and consistency in producing a selection of test images, demonstrating that the various methods and implementations of radiative transfer calculations are highly consistent. When imaging an analytic accretion model, we ﬁnd that all codes produce images similar within a pixel-wise normalized mean squared error (NMSE) of 0.012 in the worst case. When imaging a snapshot from a cell-based magnetohydrodynamic simulation, we ﬁnd all test images to be similar within NMSEs of 0.02, 0.04, 0.04, and 0.12 in Stokes I, Q, U , and V respectively. We additionally ﬁnd the values of several image metrics relevant to published EHT results to be in agreement to much better precision than measurement uncertainties.},

Comparison of the oscillation phase dependent variability and quasi-periodic oscillation-phase stacked Fe–Kα line observations will allow such discoseismic models to be conﬁrmed or ruled out as a source of particular LFQPOs.

We identiﬁed 25 4.5 µm and 24 X-ray ﬂares in archival data obtained with the Spitzer and Chandra observatories. With the help of general relativistic ray-tracing code, we modeled trajectories of “hot spots” and studied the light curves of the ﬂares for signs of the eﬀects of general relativity. Despite their apparent diversity in shape, all ﬂares share a common, exponential impulse response, a characteristic shape that is the building block of the variability. This shape is symmetric, that is, the rise and fall times are the same. Furthermore, the impulse responses in the NIR and X-ray are identical within uncertainties, with an exponential time constant τ ∼ 15 min. The observed characteristic ﬂare shape is inconsistent with hot-spot orbits viewed edgeon. Individually modeling the light curves of the ﬂares, we derived constraints on the inclination of the orbital plane of the hot spots with respect to the observer (i ∼ 30°, {\textless} 75°) and on the characteristic timescale of the intrinsic variability (tens of minutes).},

Emitted from the innermost regions of the accretion disk, this X-ray spectral component carries with it information not only about the plasma that resides in these extreme conditions, but also the black hole spin, a marker of the formation and accretion history of these objects. The models currently used to interpret the reflection spectrum are often simplistic, however, approximating the disk as an infinitely thin, optically thick plane of material orbiting in circular Keplerian orbits around the central object. Using a new relativistic ray-tracing suite (Fenrir) that allows for more complex disk approximations, we examine the effects that disk thickness may have on the reflection spectrum. Assuming a lamppost corona, we find that finite disk thickness can have a variety of effects on the reflection spectrum, including a truncation of the blue wing (from self-shadowing of the accretion disk) and an enhancement of the red wing (from the irradiation of the central “eye wall” of the inner disk). We deduce the systematic
errors on black hole spin and height that may result from neglecting these effects.},

In this work, we use a general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic (GRMHD) code to generate a thin accretion disk in Kerr spacetime and ray-tracing techniques to calculate its relativistically broadened reﬂection spectrum. We simulate NuSTAR observations and we test the capability of current reﬂection models to recover the correct input parameters.

	abstract = {We use XMM-Newton blank-sky and closed-cover background data to explore background subtraction methods for large extended sources filling the EPIC field of view, such as nearby galaxy clusters, for which local background estimation is difficult. In particular, we investigate the uncertainties of the background modeling in the 0.8-7.0 keV band that affect cluster analyses. To model the background, we have constructed composite data sets from the blank-sky observations and compared them to the individual blank-sky observations to evaluate the modeling error. Our results apply to data obtained with thin and medium optical filters and in full frame and extended full frame modes. As expected, the modeling uncertainty is determined by how the EPIC background flares are filtered. We find that to keep this uncertainty tolerable, one has to use a much more restrictive filter than that commonly applied. In particular, because flares have highly variable spectra, not all of them are identified by filtering the E{\textgreater}10 keV light curve. We tried using the outer part of the EPIC field of view for monitoring the background in a softer band (1-5 keV). We find that one needs to discard the time periods when either the hard-band or the soft-band rate exceeds the nominal value by more than 20\% in order to limit the 90\% CL background uncertainty to between +/-5\% at E=4-7 keV and +/-20\% at E=0.8-1 keV, for both MOS and PN. This compares to a 10\%-30\% respective PN uncertainty when only the hard-band light curve is used for filtering, and to a 15\%-45\% PN uncertainty when applying the commonly used 2-3 σ filtering method. Adding such a soft-band filter on average results in only a 5\%-10\% reduction of the useful exposure time. We illustrate our method on the nearby cluster A1795. The above background uncertainties convert into systematic temperature uncertainties between about +/-1\% at r=3'-4' and +/-20\%-25\% (about +/-1 keV for A1795) at r=10'-15'. For comparison, the commonly applied 2-3 σ clipping of the hard-band light curve misses a significant number of flares, rendering the temperatures beyond r=10' unconstrained. Thus, the background uncertainties do not prohibit the EPIC temperature profile analysis of low-brightness regions, such as outer regions of galaxy clusters, provided a conservative flare filtering such as the double-filtering method with +/-20\% limits is used.},

We include all relativistic effects such as frame-dragging, Doppler boost, gravitational redshift, and bending of light by the gravity of the black hole. We also include self-irradiation of the disk as a result of light deflection. Assuming that the disk emission is locally blackbody, we show how the observed spectrum depends on the spin of the black hole, the inclination of the disk, and the torque at the inner edge of the disk. We find that the effect of a nonzero torque on the spectrum can, to a good approximation, be absorbed into a zero-torque model by adjusting the mass accretion rate and the normalization. We describe a computer model, called KERRBB, which we have developed for fitting the spectra of black hole X-ray binaries. Using KERRBB within the X-ray data reduction package XSPEC, and assuming a spectral hardening factor fcol=1.7, we analyze the spectra of three black hole X-ray binaries: 4U 1543-47, XTE J1550-564, and GRO J1655-40. We estimate the spin parameters of the black holes in 4U 1543-47 and GRO J1655-40 to be a/M{\textasciitilde}0.6 and {\textasciitilde}0.6-0.7, respectively. If fcol{\textasciitilde}1.5-1.6, as in a recent study, then we find a/M{\textasciitilde}0.7-0.8 and {\textasciitilde}0.8-0.9, respectively.

As one application of the technique, it is shown that the extraction of the rotational energy of a black hole, although possible in principle (e.g., the "Penrose-Christodoulou" process), is unlikely in any astrophysically plausible context. As another application, it is shown that, in order to emit "scalar synchrotron radiation," a particle must be highly relativistic as seen in the locally nonrotating frame-and can therefore not move along an astrophysically reasonable orbit. The paper includes a number of useful formulae for particle orbits in the Kerr metric, many of which have not been published previously.},

The transfer function depends strongly on the polar angle of the observer: An observer near the plane of the disk sees radiation from its hot inner regions to be less redshifted and to subtend a greater solid angle than does an observer near the disk's polar axis. Consequently, the equatorial observer sees a much harder spectrum at high energies than does the polar observer. This effect is more pronounced for black holes of larger angular momentum.

Compared to the zero-spin Schwarzschild case, the bending angle is greater for direct orbits, and smaller for retrograde orbits, confirming our physical intuition about the loss of left-right symmetry from a lensing perspective. In addition, we show that for higher spins, the effect is more pronounced resulting in tighter winding of direct orbits with respect to the axis of rotation, and a higher degree of unwinding of retrograde orbits. A direct consequence of this effect is a shift in image positions in strong gravitational lensing.},

Separating the circular orbits into four qualitatively different classes according to the sign of the canonical angular momentum of the motion and the orientation of the Lorentz force, we analyze the circular orbits using the so-called force formalism. We find the analytical solutions for the radial profiles of velocity, specific angular momentum, and specific energy of the circular orbits in dependence on the black-hole dimensionless spin and the magnetic field strength. The innermost stable circular orbits are determined for all four classes of the circular orbits. The stable circular orbits with an outward-oriented Lorentz force can extend to radii lower than the radius of the corresponding photon circular geodesic. We calculate the frequencies of the harmonic oscillatory motion of the charged particles in the radial and vertical directions related to the equatorial circular orbits and study the radial profiles of the radial, ωr; vertical, ωθ; and orbital, ωϕ, frequencies, finding significant differences in comparison to the epicyclic geodesic circular motion. The most important new phenomenon is the existence of toroidal charged particle epicyclic motion with ωr∼ωθ≫ωϕ that could occur around retrograde circular orbits with an outward-oriented Lorentz force. We demonstrate that for the rapidly rotating black holes the role of the “Wald induced charge” can be relevant.},

We present a detailed, general relativistic approach to model this irradiation for different geometries of the primary X-ray source. These geometries include the standard point source on the rotational axis as well as more jet-like sources, which are radially elongated and accelerating. Incorporating this code in the relline model for relativistic line emission, the line shape for any configuration can be predicted. We study how different irradiation geometries affect the determination of the spin of the black hole. Broad emission lines are produced only for compact irradiating sources situated close to the black hole. This is the only case where the black hole spin can be unambiguously determined. In all other cases the line shape is narrower, which could either be explained by a low spin or an elongated source. We conclude that in those cases and independent of the quality of the data no unique solution for the spin exists and therefore only a lower limit of the spin value can be given.},

Here we report on tests of the consistency and accuracy of the general relativistic radiative transfer codes used within the collaboration to model M87* and Sgr A*. We compare and evaluate (1) deﬂection angles for equatorial null geodesics in a Kerr spacetime; (2) images calculated from a series of simple, parameterized matter distributions in the Kerr metric using simpliﬁed emissivities and absorptivities; (3) for a subset of codes, images calculated from general relativistic magnetohydrodynamics simulations using different realistic synchrotron emissivities and absorptivities; (4) observables for the 2017 conﬁguration of EHT, including visibility amplitudes and closure phases. The error in total ﬂux is of order 1\% when the codes are run with production numerical parameters. The dominant source of discrepancies for small camera distances is the location and detailed setup of the software “camera” that each code uses to produce synthetic images. We ﬁnd that when numerical parameters are suitably chosen and the camera is sufﬁciently far away the images converge and that for given transfer coefﬁcients, numerical uncertainties are unlikely to limit parameter estimation for the current generation of EHT observations. The purpose of this paper is to describe a veriﬁcation and comparison of EHT radiative transfer codes. It is not to verify EHT models more generally.},

Our code computes the transfer function for a spacetime described by the Johannsen metric and can easily be extended to any stationary, axisymmetric, and asymptotically ﬂat spacetime. Transfer functions and single line shapes in the Kerr metric are compared tothose calculated from existing codes to check that we reach the necessary accuracy.

	abstract = {The relativistically broad X-ray iron line seen in many active galactic nucleus (AGN) spectra is thought to originate from the central regions of the putative black hole accretion disk. Both the line profile and strength will vary in response to rapid variability of the primary X-ray continuum source. The temporal response of the line contains information on the accretion disk structure, the X-ray source geometry, and the spin of the black hole. Since the X-ray source will have a size comparable with the fluorescing region of the accretion disk, the general
reverberation problem is not invertible. However, progress can be made, since, empirically, AGN light curves are seen to undergo dramatic short timescale variability that presumably corresponds to the creation of a single new active region within the distributed X-ray source. The iron-line response to these individual events can be described using linear transfer theory. We consider the line response to the
activation/flaring of a new X-ray emitting region. Most of our detailed calculations are performed for the case of an X-ray source on the symmetry axis and at some height above the disk plane around a Kerr black hole. We also present preliminary calculations for off-axis flares. We suggest ways in which future, high-throughput X-ray
observatories such as XMM and the Constellation X-ray Mission may use these reverberation signatures to probe both the mass and spin of AGN black holes as well as the X-ray source geometry.},

Here, we use general relativistic transfer functions for reflection of X-rays from a point source located at some height above the black hole to study the time lags expected as a function of frequency and energy in the Fe Kα line region. We explore the models and the dependence of the lags on key parameters such as the height of the X-ray source, accretion disc inclination, black hole spin and black hole mass. We then compare these models with the observed frequency- and energy-dependence of the Fe Kα line lag in NGC 4151. Assuming the optical reverberation mapping mass of 4.6 × 107 M⊙, we get a best fit to the lag profile across the Fe Kα line in the frequency range (1-2) × 10− 5 Hz for an X-ray source located at a height \$h = 7{\textasciicircum}\{+2.9\}\_\{-2.6\} R\_G\$ with a maximally spinning black hole and an inclination i \&lt; 30°.},

We then provide analytic fitting formulae for the illumination as a function of the source height h and the black hole angular momentum a. We find that for a source on the disk symmetry axis and with h/M {\textgreater} 3, the main effect of the parameter a is allowing the disk to extend to smaller radii (approaching r/M → 1 as a/M → 1) and thus allowing the illumination of regions of much higher rotational velocity and redshift. We also compute the illumination profiles for anisotropic emission associated with the motion of the source relative to the accretion disk and present the fractions of photons absorbed by the black hole, intercepted by the disk, or escaping to infinity for both isotropic and anisotropic emission for a/M = 0 and 0.99. As the anisotropy (of a source approaching the disk) increases, the illumination profile reduces (approximately) to a single power law, whose index q, because of absorption of the beamed photons by the black hole, saturates to a value no higher than q ≳ 3. Finally, we compute the fluorescent Fe line profiles associated with the specific illumination and compare them among various cases.},

	abstract = {As mathematical computing becomes more democratized in high-level languages, high-performance symbolic-numeric systems are necessary for domain scientists and engineers to get the best performance out of their machine without deep knowledge of code optimization. Naturally, users need different term types either to have different algebraic properties for them, or to use efficient data structures. To this end, we developed Symbolics.jl, an extendable symbolic system which uses dynamic multiple dispatch to change behavior depending on the domain needs. In this work we detail an underlying abstract term interface which allows for speed without sacrificing generality. We show that by formalizing a generic API on actions independent of implementation, we can retroactively add optimized data structures to our system without changing the pre-existing term rewriters. We showcase how this can be used to optimize term construction and give a 113x acceleration on general symbolic transformations. Further, we show that such a generic API allows for complementary term-rewriting implementations. Exploiting this feature, we demonstrate the ability to swap between classical term-rewriting simplifiers and e-graph-based term-rewriting simplifiers. We illustrate how this symbolic system improves numerical computing tasks by showcasing an e-graph ruleset which minimizes the number of CPU cycles during expression evaluation, and demonstrate how it simplifies a real-world reaction-network simulation to halve the runtime. Additionally, we show a reaction-diffusion partial differential equation solver which is able to be automatically converted into symbolic expressions via multiple dispatch tracing, which is subsequently accelerated and parallelized to give a 157x simulation speedup. Together, this presents Symbolics.jl as a next-generation symbolic-numeric computing environment geared towards modeling and simulation.},

The exact location of the matter in relation to the hard X-ray source is unclear, but the strength of the reflection spectrum is usually consistent with the hard X-rays being emitted above a flat accretion disc. In this paper we calculate reflection spectra for cases where the hard X-rays photoionize the surface layers of the disc to the extent that the main X- ray absorbers are significantly ionized. The temperature, ionization state and spectrum are computed in a fully self-consistent manner for the inner, radiation pressure dominated part of an accretion disc. The effects of photoionization are important typically when the accretion rate exceeds 10 per cent of the Eddington value. The reflection spectra are then steeper than the incident continuum in the soft X-ray band and are rich in emission lines which may prove to be good diagnostics of the conditions of the inner regions around accreting black holes. Reflection spectra from sources around stellar-mass black holes are also presented. The weak iron emission-line characteristic of these objects is explained.},

Reverberation lags between correlated variability in the directly observed continuum emission and that reﬂected from the accretion disc arise due to the additional light travel time between the corona and reﬂecting disc. X-ray reverberation is detected from an increasing sample of Seyfert galaxies and a number of common properties are observed, including a transition from the characteristic reverberation signature at high frequencies to a hard lag within the continuum component at low frequencies, as well a pronounced dip in the reverberation lag at 3 keV. These features are not trivially explained by the reverberation of X-rays originating from simple point sources. We therefore model reverberation from coronæ extended both over the surface of the disc and vertically. Causal propagation through its extent for both the simple case of constant velocity propagation and propagation linked to the viscous timescale in the underlying accretion disc is included as well as stochastic variability arising due to turbulence locally on the disc. We ﬁnd that the observed features of X-ray reverberation in Seyfert galaxies can be explained if the long timescale variability is dominated by the viscous propagation of ﬂuctuations through the corona. The corona extends radially at low height over the surface of the disc but with a bright central region in which ﬂuctuations propagate up the black hole rotation axis driven by more rapid variability arising from the innermost regions of the accretion ﬂow.},

Reverberation time lags occur due to light travel time delays between changes in the direct coronal emission and corresponding variations in its reflection from the accretion flow. Reverberation is detectable using light curves made in different X-ray energy bands, since the direct and reflected components have different spectral shapes. Larger, lower frequency, lags are also seen and are identified with propagation of fluctuations through the accretion flow and associated corona. We review the evidence for X-ray reverberation in active galactic nuclei and black hole X-ray binaries, showing how it can be best measured and how it may be modelled. The timescales and energy dependence of the high-frequency reverberation lags show that much of the signal is originating from very close to the black hole in some objects, within a few gravitational radii of the event horizon. We consider how these signals can be studied in the future to carry out X-ray reverberation mapping of the regions closest to black holes.},

Reverberation mapping is a powerful technique that overcomes this limitation by using echoes of light to determine the geometry and kinematics of the central regions. Variable ionizing radiation from close to the black hole drives correlated variability in surrounding gas/dust, but with a time delay due to the light travel time between the regions, allowing reverberation mapping to effectively replace spatial resolution with time resolution. Reverberation mapping is used to measure black hole masses and to probe the innermost X-ray emitting region, the UV/optical accretion disk, the broad emission line region and the dusty torus.

	abstract = {The thermal continuum emission observed from accreting black holes across X-ray bands has the potential to be leveraged as a powerful probe of the mass and spin of the central black hole. The vast majority of existing “continuum fitting” models neglect emission sourced at and within the innermost stable circular orbit (ISCO) of the black hole. Numerical simulations, however, find non-zero emission sourced from these regions. In this work we extend existing techniques by including the emission sourced from within the plunging region, utilising new analytical models which reproduce the properties of numerical accretion simulations. We show that in general the neglected intra-ISCO emission produces a hot-and-small quasi-blackbody component, but can also produce a weak power-law tail for more extreme parameter regions. A similar hot-and-small blackbody component has been added in by hand in an ad-hoc manner to previous analyses of X-ray binary spectra. We show that the X-ray spectrum of MAXI J1820+070 in a soft-state outburst is extremely well described by a full Kerr black hole disc, while conventional models which neglect intra-ISCO emission are unable to reproduce the data. We believe this represents the first robust detection of intra-ISCO emission in the literature, and allows additional constraints to be placed on the MAXI J1820+070 black hole spin which must be low a• {\textless} 0.5 to allow a detectable intra-ISCO region. Emission from within the ISCO is the dominant emission component in the MAXI J1820+070 spectrum between 6 and 10 keV, highlighting the necessity of including this region. Our continuum fitting model is made publicly available.},
