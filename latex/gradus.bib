The technique is based on the orthonormal frames of "locally nonrotating observers." As one application of the technique, it is shown that the extraction of the rotational energy of a black hole, although possible in principle (e.g., the "Penrose-Christodoulou" process), is unlikely in any astrophysically plausible context. As another application, it is shown that, in order to emit "scalar synchrotron radiation," a particle must be highly relativistic as seen in the locally nonrotating frame-and can therefore not move along an astrophysically reasonable orbit. The paper includes a number of useful formulae for particle orbits in the Kerr metric, many of which have not been published previously.},

To avoid the technical complications of general relativity, the dynamics are treated in Newtonian fashion using the pseudo-Newtonian Paczyński-Wiita potential. The disk evolves as a result of angular momentum transport that is produced naturally from MHD turbulence generated by the magnetorotational instability. We find that the resulting stress is continuous across the marginally stable orbit, in contradiction to the widely held assumption that the stress should go to zero there. As a consequence, the specific angular momentum of the matter accreted into the hole is smaller than the specific angular momentum at the marginally stable orbit. The disk exhibits large fluctuations in almost every quantity, both spatially and temporally. In particular, the ratio of stress to pressure (the local analog of the Shakura-Sunyaev α parameter) exhibits both systematic gradients and large fluctuations; from 10-2 in the disk midplane at large radius, it rises to 10 both at a few gas density scale heights above the plane at large radius and near the midplane well inside the plunging region. Driven in part by large-amplitude waves excited near the marginally stable orbit, both the mass accretion rate and the integrated stress exhibit large fluctuations whose Fourier power spectra are smooth "red" power laws stretching over several orders of magnitude in timescale.},

Gas pressure dominates near the equator; magnetic pressure is more important in the surrounding atmosphere. A magnetically dominated bound outflow is driven from the disk. The accretion rate through the disk exceeds the final rate into the hole, and a hot torus forms inside 10rg. Hot gas, pushed up against the centrifugal barrier and confined by magnetic pressure, is ejected in a narrow, unbound, conical outflow. The dynamics are controlled by magnetic turbulence, not thermal convection, and a hydrodynamic α-model is inadequate to describe the flow. The limitations of two-dimensional MHD simulations are also discussed.},

Accretion is driven by turbulent stresses generated self-consistently by the magnetorotational instability. The resulting flow has three well-defined dynamical components: a hot, thick, rotationally dominated Keplerian disk; a surrounding magnetized corona with vigorous circulation and outflow; and a magnetically confined jet along the centrifugal funnel wall. Inside 10 gravitational radii, the disk becomes very hot, more toroidal, and highly intermittent. These results contrast sharply with quasi-spherical, self-similar viscous models. There are no significant dynamical differences between simulations that include resistive heating and those that do not. We conclude by deducing some simple radiative properties of our solutions, and apply the results to the accretion-powered Galactic center source Sgr A*.},

	abstract = {Summation-by-parts (SBP) operators have a number of properties that make them an attractive option for higher-order spatial discretizations of partial differential equations. In particular, they enable the derivation of higher-order boundary closures leading to provable time stability. When implemented on multi-block structured meshes in conjunction with simultaneous approximation terms (SATs)—penalty terms that impose boundary and interblock-coupling conditions in a weak sense—they offer additional properties of value, even for second-order accurate schemes and steady problems. For example, they involve low communication overhead for efficient parallel algorithms and relax the continuity requirements of both the mesh and the solution across block interfaces. This paper provides a brief history of seminal contributions to, and applications of, SBP-SAT methods followed by a description of their properties and a methodology for deriving SBP operators for first derivatives and second derivatives with variable coefficients. A procedure for deriving SATs is also provided. Practical aspects are discussed, including artificial dissipation, transformation to curvilinear coordinates, and application to the Navier–Stokes equations. Recent developments are reviewed, including a variational interpretation, the connection to quadrature rules, functional superconvergence, error estimates, and dual consistency. Finally, the connection to quadrature rules is exploited to provide a generalization of the SBP concept to a broader class of operators, enabling a unification and rigorous development of SATs for operators such as nodal-based pseudo-spectral and some discontinuous Galerkin operators.},

	abstract = {One of the challenges when simulating astrophysical ﬂows with self-gravity is to compute the gravitational forces. In contrast to the hyperbolic hydrodynamic equations, the gravity ﬁeld is described by an elliptic Poisson equation. We present a purely hyperbolic approach by reformulating the elliptic problem into a hyperbolic diﬀusion problem, which is solved in pseudotime, using the same explicit high-order discontinuous Galerkin method we use for the ﬂow solution. The ﬂow and the gravity solvers operate on a joint hierarchical Cartesian mesh and are two-way coupled via the source terms. A key beneﬁt of our approach is that it allows the reuse of existing explicit hyperbolic solvers without modiﬁcations, while retaining their advanced features such as non-conforming and solution-adaptive grids. By updating the gravitational ﬁeld in each RungeKutta stage of the hydrodynamics solver, high-order convergence is achieved even in coupled multi-physics simulations. After verifying the expected order of convergence for single-physics and multi-physics setups, we validate our approach by a simulation of the Jeans gravitational instability. Furthermore, we demonstrate the full capabilities of our numerical framework by computing a self-gravitating Sedov blast with shock capturing in the ﬂow solver and adaptive mesh reﬁnement for the entire coupled system.},

	abstract = {Capturing the image of the shadow cast by the event horizon of an illuminated black hole is, at the most basic level, an experiment of extreme light deflection in a strongly curved spacetime. As such, the properties of an imaged shadow can be used to probe the general relativistic Kerr nature of astrophysical black holes. As an example of this prospect it is commonly asserted that a shadow can test the validity of the theory's famous `no hair theorem' for the black hole's mass and spin multipole moments. In this paper we assess this statement by calculating the shadow's equatorial radius in spacetimes with an arbitrary multipolar structure and within a slow rotation approximation. We find that when moments higher than the quadrupole are taken into account, the shadow acquires a high degree of degeneracy as a function of the deviation from the Kerr multipole moments. The results of our analysis suggest that dark objects with strongly non-Kerr multipolar structure could nevertheless produce a Kerr-like shadow with its characteristic quasi-circular shape.},

	abstract = {The major implementational problem for reversible jump Markov chain Monte Carlo methods is that there is commonly no natural way to choose jump proposals since there is no Euclidean structure in the parameter space to guide our choice. We consider mechanisms for guiding the choice of proposal. The ﬁrst group of methods is based on an analysis of acceptance probabilities for jumps. Essentially, these methods involve a Taylor series expansion of the acceptance probability around certain canonical jumps and turn out to have close connections to Langevin algorithms. The second group of methods generalizes the reversible jump algorithm by using the so-called saturated space approach. These allow the chain to retain some degree of memory so that, when proposing to move from a smaller to a larger model, information is borrowed from the last time that the reverse move was performed. The main motivation for this paper is that, in complex problems, the probability that the Markov chain moves between such spaces may be prohibitively small, as the probability mass can be very thinly spread across the space. Therefore, ﬁnding reasonable jump proposals becomes extremely important. We illustrate the procedure by using several examples of reversible jump Markov chain Monte Carlo applications including the analysis of autoregressive time series, graphical Gaussian modelling and mixture modelling.},

We report here on a newly developed simulation platform, RefleX, which allows to reproduce absorption and reflection by quasi-arbitrary geometries. We show here the reliability of our approach by comparing the results of our simulations with existing spectral models such as pexrav, MYTorus and BNTorus. RefleX implements both Compton scattering on free electrons and Rayleigh scattering and Compton scattering on bound electrons. We show the effect of bound-electron corrections on a torus geometry simulated like in MYTorus. We release with this paper the RefleX executable, as well as RXTorus, a model that assumes absorption and reflection from a torus with a varying ratio of the minor to major axis of the torus. To allow major flexibility RXTorus is also distributed in three components: absorbed primary emission, scattered radiation and fluorescent lines. RXTorus is provided for different values of the abundance, and with (atomic configuration) or without (free-electron configuration) taking into account Rayleigh scattering and bound electrons. We apply the RXTorus model in both configurations on the XMM-Newton and NuSTAR spectrum of the Compton-thick AGN NGC 424 and find that the models are able to reproduce very well the observations, but that the assumption on the bound or free state of the electrons has significant consequences on the fit parameters.},

Similar to the directional projection method of Calvo et. al., we use embedded Runge-Kutta methods to facilitate this in a computationally eﬃcient manner. Proof of the accuracy of the modiﬁed RK methods and the existence of valid relaxation parameters are given, under some restrictions. Among other examples, we apply this technique to Implicit-Explicit Runge-Kutta time integration for the Korteweg-de Vries equation and investigate the feasibility and eﬀect of conserving multiple invariants for multi-soliton solutions.},

Phys.229, 3091–3120 (doi:10.1016/j.jcp.2009.12.030)), genuinely high-order accurate finite volume and discontinuous Galerkin schemes satisfying a strict maximum principle for scalar conservation laws were developed. The main advantages of such schemes are their provable high-order accuracy and their easiness for generalization to multi-dimensions for arbitrarily high-order schemes on structured and unstructured meshes. The same idea can be used to construct high-order schemes preserving the positivity of certain physical quantities, such as density and pressure for compressible Euler equations, water height for shallow water equations and density for Vlasov–Boltzmann transport equations. These schemes have been applied in computational fluid dynamics, computational astronomy and astrophysics, plasma simulation, population models and traffic flow models. In this paper, we first review the main ideas of these maximum-principle-satisfying and positivity-preserving high-order schemes, then present a simpler implementation which will result in a significant reduction of computational cost especially for weighted essentially non-oscillatory finite-volume schemes.},

	abstract = {The second paper of this series presents two robust entropy stable shock-capturing methods for discontinuous Galerkin spectral element (DGSEM) discretizations of the compressible magneto-hydrodynamics (MHD) equations. Specifically, we use the resistive GLM-MHD equations, which include a divergence cleaning mechanism that is based on a generalized Lagrange multiplier (GLM). For the continuous entropy analysis to hold, and due to the divergence-free constraint on the magnetic field, the GLM-MHD system requires the use of non-conservative terms, which need special treatment. Hennemann et al. (2020) [25] recently presented an entropy stable shock-capturing strategy for DGSEM discretizations of the Euler equations that blends the DGSEM scheme with a subcell first-order finite volume (FV) method. Our first contribution is the extension of the method of Hennemann et al. to systems with non-conservative terms, such as the GLM-MHD equations. In our approach, the advective and non-conservative terms of the equations are discretized with a hybrid FV/DGSEM scheme, whereas the visco-resistive terms are discretized only with the high-order DGSEM method. We prove that the extended method is semi-discretely entropy stable on three-dimensional unstructured curvilinear meshes. Our second contribution is the derivation and analysis of a second entropy stable shock-capturing method that provides enhanced resolution by using a subcell reconstruction procedure that is carefully built to ensure entropy stability. We provide a numerical verification of the properties of the hybrid FV/DGSEM schemes on curvilinear meshes and show their robustness and accuracy with common benchmark cases, such as the Orszag-Tang vortex and the GEM (Geospace Environmental Modeling) reconnection challenge. Finally, we simulate a space physics application: the interaction of Jupiter's magnetic field with the plasma torus generated by the moon Io.},

	abstract = {The main result in this paper is a provably entropy stable shock capturing approach for the high order entropy stable Discontinuous Galerkin Spectral Element Method (DGSEM) based on a hybrid blending with a subcell low order variant. Since it is possible to rewrite a high order summation-by-parts (SBP) operator into an equivalent conservative finite volume form, we were able to design a low order scheme directly with the Legendre-Gauss-Lobatto (LGL) nodes that is compatible to the discrete entropy analysis used for the proof of the entropy stable DGSEM. Furthermore, we present a hybrid low order/high order discretisation where it is possible to seamlessly blend between the two approaches, while still being provably entropy stable. With tensor products and careful design of the low order scheme on curved elements, we are able to extend the approach to three spatial dimensions on unstructured curvilinear hexahedral meshes. We validate our theoretical findings and demonstrate convergence order for smooth problems, conservation of the primary quantities and discrete entropy stability for an arbitrary blending on curvilinear grids. In practical simulations, we connect the blending factor to a local troubled element indicator that provides the control of the amount of low order dissipation injected into the high order scheme. We modified an existing shock indicator, which is based on the modal polynomial representation, to our provably stable hybrid scheme. The aim is to reduce the impact of the parameters as good as possible. We describe our indicator in detail and demonstrate its robustness in combination with the hybrid scheme, as it is possible to compute all the different test cases without changing the indicator. The test cases include e.g. the double Mach reflection setup, forward and backward facing steps with shock Mach numbers up to 100. The proposed approach is relatively straight forward to implement in an existing entropy stable DGSEM code as only modifications local to an element are necessary.},

This equivalence enables the construction of provably entropy stable schemes by a specific choice of the subcell finite volume flux. We show that besides the construction of entropy stable high-order schemes, a careful choice of subcell finite volume fluxes generates split formulations of quadratic or cubic terms. Thus, by changing the subcell finite volume flux to a specific choice, we are able to generate, in a systematic way, all common split forms of the compressible Euler advection terms, such as the Ducros splitting and the Kennedy and Gruber splitting. Although these split forms are not entropy stable, we present a systematic way to prove which of those split forms are at least kinetic energy preserving. With this, we construct a unified high-order split form DG framework. We investigate with three dimensional numerical simulations of the inviscid Taylor–Green vortex and show that the new split forms enhance the robustness of high-order simulations in comparison to the standard scheme when solving turbulent vortex dominated flows. In fact, we show that for certain test cases, the novel split form discontinuous Galerkin schemes are more robust than the discontinuous Galerkin scheme with over-integration.},

	abstract = {The progenitors for many types of supernovae (SNe) are still unknown, and an approach to diagnose their physical origins is to investigate the light curve brightness and shape of a large set of SNe. However, it is often difficult to compare and contrast the existing sample studies due to differences in their approaches and assumptions, for example in how to eliminate host galaxy extinction, and this might lead to systematic errors when comparing the results. We therefore introduce the Hybrid Analytic Flux FittEr for Transients (haffet), a Python-based software package that can be applied to download photometric and spectroscopic data for transients from open online sources, derive bolometric light curves, and fit them to semi-analytical models for estimation of their physical parameters. In a companion study, we have investigated a large collection of SNe Ib and Ic observed with the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) with haffet, and here we detail the methodology and the software package to encourage more users. As large-scale surveys such as ZTF and LSST continue to discover increasing numbers of transients, tools such as haffet will be critical for enabling rapid comparison of models against data in statistically consistent, comparable and reproducable ways. Additionally, haffet is created with a Graphical User Interface mode, which we hope will boost the efficiency and make the usage much easier.},

	abstract = {The Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) has recently released high resolution images of accretion ﬂows onto two supermassive black holes. Our physical understanding of these images depends on accuracy and precision of numerical models of plasma and radiation around compact objects. The goal of this work is to speedup radiative transfer simulations used to create mock images of black holes for comparison with the EHT observations. A ray-tracing code for general relativistic and fully polarized radiative transfer through plasma in strong gravity is ported onto GPU. We describe our GPU implementation and carry out speedup tests using models of optically thin advection dominated accretion ﬂow onto black hole realized semi-analytically and in 3-D GRMHD simulations, low and very high image pixel resolutions, and two diﬀerent sets of CPU+GPUs. We show that a GPU unit with high double precision compute capability can signiﬁcantly reduce the image production computational time, with speedup factor up to approximately 1200. The signiﬁcant speedup facilitates, e.g., dynamic model ﬁtting to the EHT data, including polariemtric data. The method extension may enable studies of emission from plasma with nonthermal particle distribution functions for which accurate approximate synchrotron emissivities are not available. The signiﬁcant speedup reduces the carbon footprint of the EHT image libraries generation by at least an order of magnitude.},

	abstract = {I review the current status of X-ray reflection (a.k.a. broad iron line) based black hole spin measurements. This is a powerful technique that allows us to measure robust black hole spins across the mass range, from the stellar-mass black holes in X-ray binaries to the supermassive black holes in active galactic nuclei. After describing the basic assumptions of this approach, I lay out the detailed methodology focusing on "best practices" that have been found necessary to obtain robust results. Reflecting my own biases, this review is slanted towards a discussion of supermassive black hole (SMBH) spin in active galactic nuclei (AGN). Pulling together all of the available XMM-Newton and Suzaku results from the literature that satisfy objective quality control criteria, it is clear that a large fraction of SMBHs are rapidly-spinning, although there are tentative hints of a more slowly spinning population at high ( M{\textgreater}5×107 M ⊙) and low ( M{\textless}2×106 M ⊙) mass. I also engage in a brief review of the spins of stellar-mass black holes in X-ray binaries. In general, reflection-based and continuum-fitting based spin measures are in agreement, although there remain two objects (GRO J1655-40 and 4U 1543-475) for which that is not true. I end this review by discussing the exciting frontier of relativistic reverberation, particularly the discovery of broad iron line reverberation in XMM-Newton data for the Seyfert galaxies NGC 4151, NGC 7314 and MCG-5-23-16. As well as confirming the basic paradigm of relativistic disk reflection, this detection of reverberation demonstrates that future large-area X-ray observatories such as LOFT will make tremendous progress in studies of strong gravity using relativistic reverberation in AGN.},

	abstract = {The rate of observable tidal disruption events (TDEs) by the most massive ( few × 107M ) black holes (BHs) is suppressed due to direct capture of stars by the event horizon. This suppression eﬀect depends on the shape of the horizon and holds the promise of probing the spin distribution of dormant BHs at the centers of galaxies. By extending the frozen-in approximation commonly used in the Newtonian limit, we propose a general relativistic criterion for the tidal disruption of a star of given interior structure. The rate suppression factor is then calculated for diﬀerent BH masses, spins, and realistic stellar populations. We ﬁnd that either a high BH spin ( 0.5) or a young stellar population ( 1 Gyr) allows TDEs to be observed from BHs signiﬁcantly more massive than 108 M . We call this spin-age degeneracy (SAD). This limits our utility of the TDE rate to constrain the BH spin distribution, unless additional constraints on the age of the stellar population or the mass of the disrupted star can be obtained by modeling the TDE radiation or the stellar spectral energy distribution near the galactic nuclei.},

The black hole potential is approximated by the Paczynski–Wiita pseudo-Newtonian potential. In particular, we use our simulations to critically assess two widely discussed models for high-frequency quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs), global oscillation modes (diskoseismology), and parametric resonance instabilities. We ﬁnd that initially disturbed hydrodynamic disks clearly display the trapped global g-mode oscillation predicted by linear perturbation theory. In contrast, the sustained turbulence produced in the simulated MHD disks by the magnetorotational instability does not excite these trapped g-modes. We cannot say at present whether the MHD turbulence actively damps the hydrodynamic g-mode. Our simulated MHD disks also fail to display any indications of a parametric resonance instability between the vertical and radial epicyclic frequencies. However, we do see characteristic frequencies at any given radius in the disk corresponding to local acoustic waves. We also conduct a blind search for any QPO in a proxy light curve based on the instantaneous mass accretion rate of the black hole, and place an upper limit of 2\% on the total power in any such feature. We highlight the importance of correcting for secular changes in the simulated accretion disk when performing temporal analyses.},

	abstract = {With most physicists and astrophysicists in agreement that black holes do indeed exist, the focus of astrophysical black hole research has shifted to the detailed properties of these systems. Nature has provided us with an extremely useful probe of the region very close to an accreting black hole—X-ray irradiation of relatively cold material in the vicinity of the black hole can imprint characteristic features into the X-ray spectra of black hole systems, most notably the Kα fluorescent line of iron. Detailed X-ray spectroscopy of these features can be used to study Doppler and gravitational redshifts, thereby providing key information on the location and kinematics of the cold material. This is a powerful tool that allows us to probe within a few gravitational radii, or less, of the event horizon. Here, we present a comprehensive review of relativistic iron line studies for both accreting stellar mass black holes (i.e., galactic black hole candidate systems, GBHCs), and accreting supermassive black holes (i.e., active galactic nuclei, AGN). We begin with a pedagogical introduction to astrophysical black holes, GBHCs, AGN, and accretion disks (including a brief discussion of recent work on the magnetohydrodynamical properties of accretion disks). We then discuss studies of relativistic iron lines in the AGN context, and show how differences between classes of AGN can be diagnosed using X-ray spectroscopy. Furthermore, through a detailed discussion of one particular object (MCG–6-30-15), we illustrate how the exotic physics of black hole spin, such as the Penrose and Blandford-Znajek processes, are now open to observational study. We proceed to discuss GBHCs, which turn out to possess rather more complicated X-ray spectra, making robust conclusions more difficult to draw. However, even in these cases, modern X-ray observatories are now providing convincing evidence for relativistic effects. We conclude by discussing the science that can be addressed by future X-ray observatories.},

	abstract = {The spacetime around astrophysical black holes is thought to be described by the Kerr solution. However, even within general relativity, there is not yet a proof that the final product of the complete collapse of an uncharged body can only be a Kerr black hole. We can thus speculate on the possibility that the spacetime around astrophysical black holes may be described by other solutions of the Einstein Equations and we can test such a hypothesis with observations. In this work, we consider the \${\textbackslash}delta\$-Kerr metric, which is an exact solution of the field equations in vacuum and can be obtained from a non-linear superposition of the Kerr metric with a static axially symmetric solution, often referred to as the \${\textbackslash}delta\$-metric. The parameter \${\textbackslash}delta=1+q\$ quantifies the departure of the source from the Kerr metric and for \$q=0\$ we recover the Kerr solution. From the analysis of the reflection features in the X-ray spectrum of the Galactic black hole in EXO 1846-031, we find \$-0.1 {\textless} q {\textless} 0.7\$ (90\% CL), which is consistent with the hypothesis that the spacetime around the compact object in EXO 1846-031 is a Kerr black hole but does not entirely rule out the \${\textbackslash}delta\$-Kerr metric.},

	abstract = {Methods. As a ﬁrst step in this direction, we perform three dimensional general relativistic hydrodynamic simulations of rotating transonic ﬂows with velocity perturbations injected from a spherical boundary located far away from the central object (1000 gravitational radii). We study the general properties of these ﬂows with varying angular momentum and perturbation amplitudes. We analyze time series of mass and angular momentum radial ﬂuxes, angle- and time-averaged proﬁles, and synthetic Bremsstrahlung lightcurves, as well as the three-dimensional structure of the ﬂow, and quantify shock- and sonic transitions in the solutions.
Results. We observe a rich phenomenology in accretion patterns, that includes smooth Bondi-like ﬂows, turbulent torus-like structures, shocks, ﬁlaments, and complex sonic structures. For suﬃciently large perturbations and angular momentum, radial proﬁles deviate from the constant entropy and constant angular momentum proﬁles used for initialization and resemble those of advection dominated accretion ﬂows, showing evidence of entropy generation and angular momentum redistribution not mediated by magnetic ﬁelds. Time series do not show the secular decreasing trend and are suitable for long-term variability studies. We see that the ﬂuctuations are ampliﬁed and extend further in frequency than the injected spectrum, producing a red noise spectrum both for mass accretion rate and the synthetic light curves.
Conclusions. We present a simulation setup that can produce a wide variety of ﬂow patterns at horizon scales and incorporate information from large scale accretion models. Future inclusion of magnetic ﬁelds and radiative cooling could make this type of simulations a viable alternative for numerical modeling of general low-luminosity active galactic nuclei.},

Both an equipartition analysis and a detailed afterglow model reveals the radio/mm emitting plasma to be expanding mildly relativistically (Lorentz factor Γ f ew) with an opening angle θj 0.1 and roughly ﬁxed energy Ej,iso f ew × 1053 erg into an external medium of density proﬁle n ∝ R−k with k 1.5 − 2, broadly similar to that of the ﬁrst jetted TDE candidate Swift J1644+57 and consistent with Bondi accretion at a rate ∼ 10−3M˙ Edd onto a 106M black hole before the outburst. The rapidly decaying optical emission phase over the ﬁrst days after discovery is consistent with fast-cooling synchrotron radiation from the same forward shock as the radio/mm emission, while the bluer slowly decaying phase to follow likely represents a separate thermal emission component unrelated to the jet. Emission from the reverse shock may have peaked during the ﬁrst days after discovery, but whose non-detection in the optical light curve places an upper bound Γj 100 on the Lorentz factor of the unshocked jet. Although a TDE origin for AT 2022cmc is indeed supported by some observations, the vast diﬀerence between the short-lived jet activity phase tX days relative to the months-long thermal optical emission, also challenges this scenario. A stellar core-collapse event giving birth to a magnetar or black hole engine of peak duration ∼ 1 day, which both generates a successful relativistic jet and powers a bright optical supernova, oﬀers an alternative model also consistent with the circumburst environment, if interpreted as a massive-star wind.},

Its published model required a single-Comptonization spectrum reflecting from a disk close to the innermost stable circular orbit. We studied that model as well as a number of other single-Comptonization models (yielding similarly low inner radii), but found they violate a number of basic physical constraints, e.g., their compactness is much above the maximum allowed by pair equilibrium. We also studied the contemporaneous 0.55–6 keV spectrum from the Swift/X-ray Telescope and found it well fitted by an absorbed power law and a disk blackbody with the innermost temperature of 0.1 keV. The normalization of the disk blackbody corresponds to an inner radius of ≳20 gravitational radii and its temperature, to irradiation of the truncated disk by a hot inner flow. We have also developed a Comptonization/reflection model including the disk irradiation and intrinsic dissipation, but found that it does not yield any satisfactory fits. On the other hand, we found that the ≤10 keV band from RXTE is much better fitted by a reflection from a disk with the inner radius ≳100 gravitational radii, which model then underpredicts the spectrum at {\textgreater}10 keV by {\textless}10\%. We argue that the most plausible explanation of the above results is inhomogeneity of the source, with the local spectra hardening with the decreasing radius. Our results support the presence of a complex Comptonization region and a large disk truncation radius in this source.},

	abstract = {Low Frequency QPOs (LFQPOs) have always been seen uniquely as a timing feature, with most models focused on reproducing only their timing behavior. Previously, the Accretion-Ejection Instability (AEI) predicted the existence of a more subtle effect on their energy spectrum. In the case of LMXB, that effect was deemed impossible to detect. While the AEI can be naturally expanded to higher-mass systems, there was no observational drive to do it until now. However the several (candidate) QPOs detected in supermassive black hole sources in the last decade, now seems the right moment to explore the applicability of the AEI model. Using our numerical observatory, we compute the different observables for a system with the AEI active and we take advantage of the longer timescale coming from the higher mass system, to see if the effect on the energy spectrum hinted at in LMXB, could become detectable. After confirming that the AEI causes an imprint of the QPO on the energy spectrum that should reach detectable levels in SMBH, we turned to observations of 2XMM J123103.2 and performed a proof of concept spectro-timing fit of the QPO pulse profile simultaneously with how its energy spectrum changes along it. While the limited 2XMM J123103.2 data showed the predicted effect at only \$1.7{\textbackslash}sigma\$, it is fully consistent with the AEI model and hence worthy of further investigation in other systems.},

	abstract = {The image of a supermassive black hole surrounded by an optically-thin, radiatively-ineﬃcient accretion ﬂow, like that observed with the Event Horizon Telescope, is characterized by a bright ring of emission surrounding the black-hole shadow. In the Kerr spacetime this bright ring, when narrow, closely traces the boundary of the shadow and can, with appropriate calibration, serve as its proxy. The present paper expands the validity of this statement by considering two particular spacetime geometries: a solution to the ﬁeld equations of a modiﬁed gravity theory and another that parametrically deviates from Kerr but recovers the Kerr spacetime when its deviation parameters vanish. A covariant, axisymmetric analytic model of the accretion ﬂow based on conservation laws and spanning a broad range of plasma conditions is utilized to calculate synthetic non-Kerr black-hole images, which are then analysed and characterized. We ﬁnd that in all spacetimes: (i) it is the gravitationally-lensed unstable photon orbit that plays the critical role in establishing the diameter of the rings observed in black-hole images, not the event horizon or the innermost stable circular orbit, (ii) bright rings in these images scale in size with, and encompass, the boundaries of the black-hole shadows, even when deviating signiﬁcantly from Kerr, and (iii) uncertainties in the physical properties of the accreting plasma introduce subdominant corrections to the relation between the diameter of the image and the diameter of the black-hole shadow. These results provide theoretical justiﬁcation for using black-hole images to probe and test the spacetimes of supermassive black holes.},

	abstract = {We present a new and complete library of synthetic spectra for modeling the component of emission that is reflected from an illuminated accretion disk. The spectra were computed using an updated version of our code xillver that incorporates new routines and a richer atomic database. We offer in the form of a table model an extensive grid of reflection models that cover a wide range of parameters. Each individual model is characterized by the photon index Γ of the illuminating radiation, the ionization parameter ξ at the surface of the disk (i.e., the ratio of the X-ray flux to the gas density), and the iron abundance AFe relative to the solar value. The ranges of the parameters covered are 1.2 ⩽ Γ ⩽ 3.4, 1 ⩽ ξ ⩽ 104, and 0.5 ⩽ AFe ⩽ 10. These ranges capture the physical conditions typically inferred from observations of active galactic nuclei, and also stellar-mass black holes in the hard state. This library is intended for use when the thermal disk flux is faint compared to the incident power-law flux. The models are expected to provide an accurate description of the Fe K emission line, which is the crucial spectral feature used to measure black hole spin. A total of 720 reflection spectra are provided in a single FITS file (http://hea-www.cfa.harvard.edu/ javier/xillver/) suitable for the analysis of X-ray observations via the atable model in xspec. Detailed comparisons with previous reflection models illustrate the improvements incorporated in this version of xillver.},

An important issue is the lack of measurements that are usually employed to fine-tune calculations so as to attain spectroscopic accuracy. In order to estimate data quality, several atomic structure codes are used and extensive comparisons with previous theoretical data have been carried out. In the calculation of K photoabsorption with the Breit–Pauli R-matrix method, both radiation and Auger dampings, which cause the smearing of the K edge, are taken into account.

This set of models covers different values of ionization parameter, solar iron abundance, and photon index for the illuminating spectrum. These models also include the most complete and recent atomic data for the inner shell of the iron and oxygen isonuclear sequences. We concentrate our analysis on the 2–10 keV energy region and in particular on the iron K-shell emission lines. We show the dependency of the equivalent width (EW) of the Fe Kα on the ionization parameter. The maximum value of the EW is ∼800 eV for models with log ξ ∼ 1.5 and decreases monotonically as ξ increases. For lower values of ξ, the Fe Kα EW decreases to a minimum near log ξ ∼ 0.8. We produce simulated CCD observations based on our reflection models. For low-ionized, reflection-dominated cases, the 2–10 keV energy region shows a very broad, curving continuum that cannot be represented by a simple power law. We show that in addition to the Fe K-shell emission, there are other prominent features such as the Si and S Lα lines, a blend of Ar viii–xi lines, and the Ca x Kα line. In some cases, the S xv blends with the He-like Si radiative recombination continua producing a broad feature that cannot be reproduced by a simple Gaussian profile. This could be used as a signature of reflection.},

	abstract = {Using backwards ray tracing, we study the shadows of Kerr black holes with scalar hair (KBHsSH). KBHsSH interpolate continuously between Kerr BHs and boson stars (BSs), so we start by investigating the lensing of light due to BSs. Moving from the weak to the strong gravity region, BSs - which by themselves have no shadows - are classified, according to the lensing produced, as: \$(i)\$ non-compact, which yield no multiple images; \$(ii)\$ compact, which produce an increasing number of Einstein rings and multiple images of the whole celestial sphere; \$(iii)\$ ultra-compact, which possess light rings, yielding an infinite number of images with (we conjecture) a self-similar structure. The shadows of KBHsSH, for Kerr-like horizons and non-compact BS-like hair, are analogous to, but distinguishable from, those of comparable Kerr BHs. But for non-Kerr-like horizons and ultra-compact BS-like hair, the shadows of KBHsSH are drastically different: novel shapes arise, sizes are considerably smaller and multiple shadows of a single BH become possible. Thus, KBHsSH provide quantitatively and qualitatively new templates for ongoing (and future) very large baseline interferometry (VLBI) observations of BH shadows, such as those of the Event Horizon Telescope.},

Both the polarization degree and the angle exhibit variability with pulse phase, which allowed us to measure the pulsar spin position angle 57(2) deg and the magnetic obliquity 12(4) deg, which is an essential step towards detailed modelling of the intrinsic emission of X-ray pulsars. Combining our results with the optical polarimetric data, we ﬁnd that the spin axis of the neutron star and the angular momentum of the binary orbit are misaligned by at least ∼20 deg, which is a strong argument in support of the models explaining stability of the observed super-orbital variability with the precession of the neutron star.},

We do so in the context of hairy black hole solutions, where the hair is associated with a new scalar degree of freedom, forecasting that LISA and TianQin will be able to constrain deviations of \$c\_\{GW\}\$ from the speed of light at the \$\{{\textbackslash}cal O\}(10{\textasciicircum}\{-4\})\$ level from a single supermassive black hole merger. We discuss how these constraints depend on the nature of the scalar hair, what different aspects of the underlying physics they are sensitive to in comparison with constraints derived from gravitational wave propagation effects, which observable systems will place the most stringent bounds, and that constraints are expected to improve by up to two orders of magnitude with multiple observations. This is especially interesting for dark energy-related theories, where existing bounds from GW170817 need not apply at lower frequencies and where upcoming bounds from lower-frequency missions will therefore be especially powerful. As such, we also forecast analogous bounds for the intermediate-frequency AEDGE and DECIGO missions. Finally, we discuss and forecast analogous black hole ringdown constraints at higher frequencies (so from LVK, the Einstein Telescope and Cosmic Explorer) and in what circumstances they can yield new information on top of existing constraints on \$c\_\{GW\}\$.

Here, we study the evolution of stellar-mass binary black holes (BBHs) embedded within AGN disks using three-dimensional hydrodynamic simulations and analytic methods, focusing on environments where the AGN disk scale height H is the BBH sphere of inﬂuence. We model the local surroundings of the embedded BBHs using a wind tunnel formalism and characterize different accretion regimes based on the local properties of the disk. We develop prescriptions for accretion and drag for embedded BBHs. Using these prescriptions with AGN disk models that can represent the Toomre-unstable outer regions of AGN disks, we study the long-term evolution of BBHs as they migrate through the disk. We ﬁnd that BBHs typically merge within 1 − 30 Myr, increasing their mass signiﬁcantly in the process, allowing BBHs to enter (or cross) the pair-instability supernova mass gap. The BBH accretion rate often exceeds the Eddington limit, sometimes by several orders of magnitude. Many embedded BBHs will merge before migrating signiﬁcantly in the disk. We also discuss possible electromagnetic signatures during and following the inspiral, ﬁnding that it is generally unlikely for the bolometric luminosity of the BBH to exceed the AGN luminosity.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/2301.10378},
	abstract = {Photon trapping is believed to be an important mechanism in super-Eddington accretion, which greatly reduces the radiative eﬃciency as photons are swallowed by the central black hole before they can escape from the accretion ﬂow. This eﬀect is interpreted as the radial advection of energy in one-dimensional height-integrated models, such as the slim disc model. However, when multi-dimensional eﬀects are considered, the conventional understanding may no longer hold. In this paper, we study the advective energy transport in super-Eddington accretion, based on a new two-dimensional inﬂow-outﬂow solution with radial self-similarity, in which the advective factor is calculated self-consistently by incorporating the calculation of radiative ﬂux, instead of being set as an input parameter. We found that radial advection is actually a heating mechanism in the inﬂow due to compression, and the energy balance in the inﬂow is maintained by cooling via radiation and vertical ( -direction) advection, which transports entropy upwards to be radiated closer to the surface or carried away by the outﬂow. As a result, less photons are advected inwards and more photons are released from the surface, so that the mean advective factor is smaller and the emergent ﬂux is larger than those predicted by the slim disc model. The radiative eﬃciency of super-Eddington accretion thus should be larger than that of the slim disc model, which agrees with the results of some recent numerical simulations.},

The model employs two X-ray sources located along the black hole rotational axis at height, \$h\_1\$ and \$h\_2\$ respectively. These sources have their associated photon indices \${\textbackslash}Gamma\_1\$ and \${\textbackslash}Gamma\_2\$ which respond to fluctuations in the disc with a maximum response duration of \$t\_{\textbackslash}text\{max\}\$ and a propagation delay between the response of the two of \$t\_{\textbackslash}text\{shift\}\$. We find that for 1H 0707-495, \$h\_2\$ is significantly correlated with \${\textbackslash}Gamma\_1\$ and anti-correlated with ionisation \${\textbackslash}xi\$. Whilst the 1H 0707-495 corona extends upwards, the emission appears softer and the disc is less ionised. We find similarities in IRAS 13224-3809, but significant anti-correlation between \${\textbackslash}Gamma\_2\$ and both \$t\_{\textbackslash}text\{max\}\$ and \$t\_{\textbackslash}text\{shift\}\$. This suggests that when the IRAS 13224-3809 corona becomes softer while extending vertically upwards, the overall corona response occurs faster. This may also suggest that the inner disc also becomes more active. In addition, \${\textbackslash}Gamma\_1\$ and \${\textbackslash}Gamma\_2\$ are extreme, relatively less variable, but more separate in IRAS 13224-3809 than in 1H 0707-495. This suggests that the IRAS 13224-3809 corona may be more patchy in the sense that it has two more clear distinct spectral zones of \${\textbackslash}Gamma\_1\$ and \${\textbackslash}Gamma\_2\$ (possibly relating to two distinct zones of coronal temperature) when compared to 1H 0707-495.},

J0744 was first detected as a new, ultra-soft X-ray source (photon index \${\textbackslash}sim 4\$) during the second SRG/eROSITA All-Sky Survey (eRASS2), where it had brightened in the 0.3--2{\textasciitilde}keV band by a factor of more than \${\textbackslash}sim\$160 relative to an archival 3\${\textbackslash}sigma\$ upper limit inferred from a serendipitous Chandra pointing in 2011. The transient was also independently found in the optical by the Zwicky Transient Factory (ZTF), with the eRASS2 detection occurring only \${\textbackslash}sim\$20 days after the peak optical brightness, suggesting that the accretion disc formed promptly in this TDE. Continued X-ray monitoring over the following \${\textbackslash}sim\$400 days by eROSITA, NICER XTI and Swift XRT showed a net decline by a factor of \${\textbackslash}sim\$100, albeit with large amplitude X-ray variability where the system fades, and then rebrightens, in the 0.3--2{\textasciitilde}keV band by a factor \${\textbackslash}sim\$50 during an 80 day period. Contemporaneous Swift UVOT observations during this extreme X-ray variability reveal a relatively smooth decline, which persists over \${\textbackslash}sim\$400 days post-optical peak. The peak observed optical luminosity (absolute \$g\$-band magnitude \${\textbackslash}sim -16.8\$ mag) from this transient makes J0744 the faintest optically-detected TDE observed to date. However, contrasting the known set of `faint and fast' TDEs, the optical emission from J0744 decays slowly (exponential decay timescale \${\textbackslash}sim\$120{\textasciitilde}days), making J0744 the first member of a potential new class of `faint and slow' TDEs.},

	abstract = {Supermassive black hole binaries (SMBHBs) are natural by-products of galaxy mergers and are expected to be powerful multi-messenger sources. They can be powered by the accretion of matter and shine throughout the electromagnetic spectrum similarly to normal active galactic nuclei (AGNs). Current electromagnetic observatories have good chances to detect and identify these systems in the near future, but we need precise observational indicators to distinguish single AGNs from SMBHBs. In this work, we propose a novel electromagnetic signature from SMBHBs: periodic flares caused by the interaction between the jets launched by the black holes. We investigate close black hole binaries accreting matter from a circumbinary disc and the mini-discs formed around each hole, and launching magnetically-dominated jets in the direction of their spin through the Blandfor--Znajeck mechanism. If the spins are slightly inclined, the two jets will encounter each other once per orbit. We argue that this interaction may trigger strong magnetic reconnection events where particles are accelerated and form plasmoids that emit non-thermal radiation. We model the evolution of these particles and calculate the radiative output obtaining spectra and light curves at different wavelengths. We show that these flares can significantly shine in radio, soft X-rays, and {\textbackslash}gamma rays, providing a periodic multi-wavelength electromagnetic signature for SMBHBs.},

We present analyses of recent joint NICER and NuSTAR spectra, which are extremely well-described by a highly inclined disk accreting into a near maximally spinning black hole. Owing to the broad X-ray coverage of NuSTAR the fitted spin and inclination are strongly constrained for our hypothesized disk models. The faintest spectra are observed out to 20 keV, even though their hard tail components are almost absent when described with a simple corona. The hard tail increases with luminosity, but shows clear two track behavior with one track having appreciably stronger tails. The disk spectrum color-correction factor is anti-correlated with the strength of the hard tail (e.g., as measured by the Compton \$y\$ parameter). Although the spin and inclination parameters are strongly constrained for our chosen model, the mass and distance are degenerate parameters. We use our spectral fits, along with a theoretical prior on color-correction, an observational prior on likely fractional Eddington luminosity, and an observational prior on distance obtained from Gaia studies, to present mass and distance contours for this system. The most likely parameters, given our presumed disk model, suggest a 4.6 \${\textbackslash}mathrm\{M\_{\textbackslash}odot\}\$ black hole at 7.8 kpc observed at luminosities ranging from \${\textbackslash}approx 1.7{\textbackslash}\%\$--\$9{\textbackslash}\%\$ of Eddington. This would place 4U 1957+11 as one of the few actively accreting sources within the `mass gap' of \$\{{\textbackslash}approx\} 2\$--\$5{\textbackslash},{\textbackslash}mathrm\{M\_{\textbackslash}odot\}\$ where there are few known massive neutron stars or low mass black holes.

In the vicinity of black holes, the inﬂuence of strong gravity, plasma physics, and emission processes govern the behavior of the system. Since observations such as those carried out by the EHT are not yet able to unambiguously constrain models for astrophysical and gravitational properties, it is imperative to explore the accretion models, particle distribution function, and description of the spacetime geometry. Our current understanding of these properties is often based on the assumption that the spacetime is well-described by by the Kerr solution to general relativity, combined with basic emission and accretion models. We explore alternative models for each property performing general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic and radiative transfer simulations. Aims. By choosing a Kerr solution to general relativity and a dilaton solution to Einstein-Maxwell-dilaton-axion gravity as exemplary black hole background spacetimes, we aim to investigate the inﬂuence of accretion and emission models on the ability to distinguish black holes in two theories of gravity.},

Results. With our blind search we retrieved about 60 sources including 15 previously known supersoft AGN or TDEs, so demonstrating the eﬃciency of our selection. Of the remaining sample, 36 sources, although showing steeper-than-usual spectra, are optically classiﬁed as AGN. The remaining nine, previously unknown sources show spectral properties consistent with the emission by extremely soft-excess dominated AGN (ﬁve sources) or TDE (four sources). An XMM-Newton follow-up observation of one of these sources conﬁrmed its likely TDE nature.
Conclusions. Our work is the ﬁrst attempt to discover TDEs by their spectral features rather than their variability and has been successful in retrieving known TDEs as well as discovering new extreme ultrasoft sources, including four new TDE candidates, one of which is conﬁrmed via follow-up observations.},

While the majority of X-ray TDEs has been identified from \{{\textbackslash}it inactive\} galaxies and some showed the highest amplitudes of variability recorded from galaxy cores (amplitudes exceeding factors of 1000--6000), a small fraction of \{{\textbackslash}it active\} galactic nuclei (AGN) has been found to be highly variable as well. In AGN, this so-called changing-look phenomenon often comes with a strong change in the optical broad emission lines, leading to Seyfert-type changes between class 1 and class 2. These two forms of activity represent the extremes of variability among active and quiescent galaxies, and have opened up a new window on understanding accretion physics under extreme conditions. Finally, we introduce the term ``frozen-look AGN'' to describe systems that show constant line emission despite strong/dramatic changes in the observed ionizing continuum. These systems are best explained by strong changes of absorption along our line-of-sight.},

	abstract = {A standard problem in gamma-ray astronomy data analysis is the decomposition of a set of observed counts, described by Poisson statistics, according to a given multicomponent linear model, with underlying physical count rates or fluxes which are to be estimated from the data. Despite its conceptual simplicity, the linear least-squares (LLSQ) method for solving this problem has generally been limited to situations in which the number ni of counts in each bin i is not too small, conventionally more than 5-30. It seems to be widely believed that the failure of the LLSQ method for small counts is due to the failure of the Poisson distribution to be even approximately normal for small numbers. The cause is more accurately the strong anticorrelation between the data and the wieghts wi in the weighted LLSQ method when square root of ni instead of square root of bar-ni is used to approximate the uncertainties, sigmai, in the data, where bar-ni = E(ni), the expected value of Ni. We show in an appendix that, avoiding this approximation, the correct equations for the Poisson LLSQ (PLLSQ) problems are actually identical to those for the maximum likelihood estimate using the exact Poisson distribution. We apply the method to solve a problem in high-resolution gamma-ray spectroscopy for the JPL High-Resolution Gamma-Ray Spectrometer flown on HEAO 3. Systematic error in subtracting the strong, highly variable background encountered in the low-energy gamma-ray region can be significantly reduced by closely pairing source and background data in short segments. Significant results can be built up by weighted averaging of the net fluxes obtained from the subtraction of many individual source/background pairs. Extension of the approach to complex situations, with multiple cosmic sources and realistic background parameterizations, requires a means of efficiently fitting to data from single scans in the narrow (approximately = 1.2 keV, HEAO 3) energy channels of a Ge spectrometer, where the expected number of counts obtained per scan may be very low. Such an analysis system is discussed and compared to the method previously used.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1507.08343},
	abstract = {Astrophysical sources are now observed by many different instruments at different wavelengths, from radio to high-energy gamma-rays, with an unprecedented quality. Putting all these data together to form a coherent view, however, is a very difficult task. Each instrument has its own data format, software and analysis procedure, which are difficult to combine. It is for example very challenging to perform a broadband fit of the energy spectrum of the source. The Multi-Mission Maximum Likelihood framework (3ML) aims to solve this issue, providing a common framework which allows for a coherent modeling of sources using all the available data, independent of their origin. At the same time, thanks to its architecture based on plug-ins, 3ML uses the existing official software of each instrument for the corresponding data in a way which is transparent to the user. 3ML is based on the likelihood formalism, in which a model summarizing our knowledge about a particular region of the sky is convolved with the instrument response and compared to the corresponding data. The user can choose between a frequentist analysis, and a Bayesian analysis. In the former, parameters of the model are optimized in order to obtain the best match to the data (i.e., the maximum of the likelihood). In the latter, the priors specified by the user are used to build the posterior distribution, which is then sampled with Markov Chain Monte Carlo or Multinest. Our implementation of this idea is very flexible, allowing the study of point sources as well as extended sources with arbitrary spectra. We will review the problem we aim to solve, the 3ML concepts and its innovative potential.},

	abstract = {The XMM Cluster Survey (XCS, Romer et al., 2001) have developed a new Python module, X-ray: Generate and Analyse (hereafter referred to as XGA) to provide interactive and automated analyses of X-ray emitting sources observed by the XMM-Newton space telescope. XGA only requires that a set of cleaned, processed, event lists has been created, and (optionally) that a source detector has generated region lists for the observations. XGA is centered around the concept of making all available data easily accessible and analysable. The user provides information (e.g. RA, Dec, redshift) on the source they wish to investigate, and XGA will locate all relevant observations and generate all required data products. This approach means that the user can quickly and easily complete common analyses without manually searching through large amounts of archival data for relevant observations, thus being left free to focus on extracting the maximum scientiﬁc gain. In the future, we will add support for X-ray telescopes other than XMM (e.g. Chandra, eROSITA), as well as the ability to perform multi-mission joint analyses. With the advent of new X-ray observatories such as eROSITA (Predehl et al., 2021), XRISM (XRISM Science Team, 2020), ATHENA (Nandra et al., 2013), and Lynx (Gaskin et al., 2019), it is the perfect time for a new, open-source, software package that is open for anyone to use and scrutinise.},

In the present paper, we study the impact of a non-vanishing black hole dilaton charge on the reflection spectrum of the disk. From the analysis of a NuSTAR spectrum of the black hole binary EXO 1846-031, we find the constraint r2 {\textless} 0.011 (90\% CL), which is an order of magnitude more stringent.},

	abstract = {When minimizing a nonlinear least-squares function, the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm can suffer from a slow convergence, particularly when it must navigate a narrow canyon en route to a best fit. On the other hand, when the least-squares function is very flat, the algorithm may easily become lost in parameter space. We introduce several improvements to the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm in order to improve both its convergence speed and robustness to initial parameter guesses. We update the usual step to include a geodesic acceleration correction term, explore a systematic way of accepting uphill steps that may increase the residual sum of squares due to Umrigar and Nightingale, and employ the Broyden method to update the Jacobian matrix. We test these changes by comparing their performance on a number of test problems with standard implementations of the algorithm. We suggest that these two particular challenges, slow convergence and robustness to initial guesses, are complimentary problems. Schemes that improve convergence speed often make the algorithm less robust to the initial guess, and vice versa. We provide an open source implementation of our improvements that allow the user to adjust the algorithm parameters to suit particular needs.},

	abstract = {This paper continues the analysis of a set of general relativistic three-dimensional MHD simulations of accreting tori in the Kerr metric with different black hole spins. We focus on bound matter inside the initial pressure maximum, where the time-averaged motion of gas is inward and an accretion disk forms. We use the flows of mass, angular momentum, and energy in order to understand dynamics in this region. The sharp reduction in accretion rate with increasing black hole spin reported in the first paper of this series is explained by a strongly spin-dependent outward flux of angular momentum conveyed electromagnetically; when a/M ≥ 0.9, this flux can be comparable to the inward angular momentum flux carried by the matter. In all cases, there is outward electromagnetic angular momentum flux throughout the flow; in other words, contrary to the assertions of traditional accretion disk theory, there is in general no "stress edge," no surface within which the stress is zero. The retardation of accretion in the inner disk by electromagnetic torques also alters the radial distribution of surface density, an effect that may have consequences for observable properties, such as Compton reflection. The net accreted angular momentum is sufficiently depressed by electromagnetic effects that in the most rapidly spinning black holes mass growth can lead to spin-down. Spinning black holes also lose energy by Poynting flux; this rate is also a strongly increasing function of black hole spin, rising to ≳10\% of the rest-mass accretion rate at very high spin. As the black hole spins faster, the path of the Poynting flux changes from being predominantly within the accretion disk to being predominantly within the funnel outflow.},

	abstract = {General relativistic (GR) magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations of black hole accretion ﬁnd signiﬁcant magnetic stresses near and inside the innermost stable circular orbit (ISCO), suggesting that such ﬂows could radiate in a manner noticeably different from the prediction of the standard model, which assumes that there are no stresses in that region. We provide estimates of how phenomenologically interesting parameters like the ‘radiation edge’, the innermost ring of the disc from which substantial thermal radiation escapes to inﬁnity, may be altered by stresses near the ISCO. These estimates are based on data from a large number of three-dimensional GRMHD simulations combined with GR ray tracing. For slowly spinning black holes (a/M {\textless} 0.9), the radiation edge lies well inside where the standard model predicts, particularly when the system is viewed at high inclination. For more rapidly spinning black holes, the contrast is smaller. At ﬁxed total luminosity, the characteristic temperature of the accretion ﬂow increases between a factor of 1.2 and 2.4 over that predicted by the standard model, whilst at ﬁxed mass accretion rate, there is a corresponding enhancement of the accretion luminosity which may be anywhere from tens of per cent to order unity. When all these considerations are combined, we ﬁnd that, for ﬁxed black hole mass, luminosity and inclination angle, our uncertainty in the characteristic temperature of the radiation reaching distant observers due to uncertainty in dissipation proﬁle (around a factor of 3) is greater than the uncertainty due to a complete lack of knowledge of the black hole’s spin (around a factor of 2) and furthermore that spin estimates based on the stress-free inner boundary condition provide an upper limit to a/M.},

Consolidating the confidence levels during cross-correlation studies, understanding the artefacts induced by sampling irregularities, establishing detection limits for future observatories are just some of the applications of simulated data sets. Currently, the widely used methodology of amplitude and phase randomization is able to produce artificial light curves which have a given underlying power spectral density (PSD) but which are strictly Gaussian distributed. This restriction is a significant limitation, since the majority of the light curves, e.g. active galactic nuclei, X-ray binaries, gamma-ray bursts, show strong deviations from Gaussianity exhibiting `burst-like' events in their light curves yielding long-tailed probability density functions (PDFs). In this study, we propose a simple method which is able to precisely reproduce light curves which match both the PSD and the PDF of either an observed light curve or a theoretical model. The PDF can be representative of either the parent distribution or the actual distribution of the observed data, depending on the study to be conducted for a given source. The final artificial light curves contain all of the statistical and variability properties of the observed source or theoretical model, i.e. the same PDF and PSD, respectively. Within the framework of Reproducible Research, the code and the illustrative example used in this paper are both made publicly available in the form of an interactive MATHEMATICA notebook.},

Indeed, using the observed image size and the broadband spectrum of Sgr A∗, it is claimed that the radius of any such thermal surface is strongly bounded from above by these latest observations. Herein, we discuss how the reported constraint relies on the extremely strong assumption of perfect balance in the energy exchange between the accretion disk and the central object, and show that this is violated whenever the surface is endowed with any non-zero absorption coeﬃcient. We discuss in detail the upper-bound constraints that can be cast on the radius and dimensionless absorption coeﬃcient of the surface. We show that the conclusions of the analysis presented by the EHT collaboration hold only for unnaturally small values of the absorption coeﬃcient (i.e. much lower than 10−14), and thus have to be signiﬁcantly revised in scenarios with physical signiﬁcance.},

	abstract = {The modified newtonian dynamics (MOND) paradigm of Milgrom can boast of a number of successful predictions regarding galactic dynamics; these are made without the assumption that dark matter plays a significant role. MOND requires gravitation to depart from Newtonian theory in the extragalactic regime where dynamical accelerations are small. So far relativistic gravitation theories proposed to underpin MOND have either clashed with the post-Newtonian tests of general relativity, or failed to provide significant gravitational lensing, or violated hallowed principles by exhibiting superluminal scalar waves or an {\textbackslash}textit\{a priori\} vector field. We develop a relativistic MOND inspired theory which resolves these problems. In it gravitation is mediated by metric, a scalar field and a 4-vector field, all three dynamical. For a simple choice of its free function, the theory has a Newtonian limit for nonrelativistic dynamics with significant acceleration, but a MOND limit when accelerations are small. We calculate the \${\textbackslash}beta\$ and \${\textbackslash}gamma\$ PPN coefficients showing them to agree with solar system measurements. The gravitational light deflection by nonrelativistic systems is governed by the same potential responsible for dynamics of particles. To the extent that MOND successfully describes dynamics of a system, the new theory's predictions for lensing by that system's visible matter will agree as well with observations as general relativity's predictions made with a dynamically successful dark halo model. Cosmological models based on the theory are quite similar to those based on general relativity; they predict slow evolution of the scalar field. For a range of initial conditions, this last result makes it easy to rule out superluminal propagation of metric, scalar and vector waves.},

Having in mind readers who are historians and philosophers of science, as well as physicists and astronomers, I describe in this review the main aspects of MOND – its statement, its basic tenets, its main predictions, and the tests of these predictions – contrasting it with the dark-matter paradigm. I then discuss possible wider ramifications of MOND, for example the potential significance of the MOND constant, a0, with possible implications for the roots of MOND in cosmology. Along the way I point to parallels with several historical instances of nascent paradigms. In particular, with the emergence of the Copernican world picture, that of quantum physics, and that of relativity, as regards their initial advent, their development, their schematic structure, and their ramifications. For example, the interplay between theories and their corollary laws, and the centrality of a new constant with converging values as deduced from seemingly unrelated manifestations of these laws. I demonstrate how MOND has already unearthed a number of unsuspected laws of galactic dynamics (to which, indeed, a0 is central) predicting them a priori, and leading to their subsequent verification. I parallel the struggle of the new with the old paradigms, and the appearance of hybrid paradigms at such times of struggle. I also try to identify in the history of those established paradigms a stage that can be likened to that of MOND today.},

	abstract = {Spectral-timing techniques have proven valuable in studying the interplay between the X-ray corona and the accretion disc in variable active galactic nuclei (AGNs). Under certain conditions, photoionized outflows emerging from central AGN regions also play a role in the observable spectral-timing properties of the nuclear components. The variable ionizing flux causes the intervening gas to ionize or recombine, resulting in a time-dependent absorption spectrum. Understanding the spectral-timing properties of these outflows is critical not only for the determination of their role in the AGN environment but also for the correct interpretation of timing signatures of other AGN components. In this paper, we test the capabilities of the Athena X-IFU instrument in studying the spectral and spectral-timing properties of a black hole system displaying a variable outflow. We take the narrow-line Seyfert 1 IRAS 13224−3809 as a test case. Our findings show that while the non-linear response of the absorbing medium can result in complex behaviour of time lags, the resulting decrease in the coherence can be used to constrain gas density and distance to the central source. Ultimately, modelling the coherence spectra of AGN outflows may constitute a valuable tool in studying the physical properties of the outflowing gas.},

	abstract = {Astronomical outliers, such as unusual, rare or unknown types of astronomical objects or phenomena, constantly lead to the discovery of genuinely unforeseen knowledge in astronomy. More unpredictable outliers will be uncovered in principle with the increment of the coverage and quality of upcoming survey data. However, it is a severe challenge to mine rare and unexpected targets from enormous data with human inspection due to a significant workload. Supervised learning is also unsuitable for this purpose since designing proper training sets for unanticipated signals is unworkable. Motivated by these challenges, we adopt unsupervised machine learning approaches to identify outliers in the data of galaxy images to explore the paths for detecting astronomical outliers. For comparison, we construct three methods, which are built upon the k-nearest neighbors (KNN), Convolutional Auto-Encoder (CAE)+ KNN, and CAE + KNN + Attention Mechanism (attCAE KNN) separately. Testing sets are created based on the Galaxy Zoo image data published online to evaluate the performance of the above methods. Results show that attCAE KNN achieves the best recall (78\%), which is 53\% higher than the classical KNN method and 22\% higher than CAE+KNN. The efficiency of attCAE KNN (10 minutes) is also superior to KNN (4 hours) and equal to CAE+KNN(10 minutes) for accomplishing the same task. Thus, we believe it is feasible to detect astronomical outliers in the data of galaxy images in an unsupervised manner. Next, we will apply attCAE KNN to available survey datasets to assess its applicability and reliability.},

The new observations, at a spatial resolution ∼2.5 times higher than before, reveal a regular H i disc rotating at about 23 km s−1. Our kinematic parameters, recovered with a robust 3D kinematic modelling fitting technique, show that the flat part of the rotation curve is reached. Intriguingly, the rotation curve can be explained almost entirely by the baryonic mass distribution alone. We show that a standard cold dark matter halo that follows the concentration–halo mass relation fails to reproduce the amplitude of the rotation curve by a large margin. Only a halo with an extremely (and arguably unfeasible) low concentration reaches agreement with the data. We also find that the rotation curve of AGC 114905 deviates strongly from the predictions of modified Newtonian dynamics. The inclination of the galaxy, which is measured independently from our modelling, remains the largest uncertainty in our analysis, but the associated errors are not large enough to reconcile the galaxy with the expectations of cold dark matter or modified Newtonian dynamics.},

We show that isophotes in the face-on view can differ from circular at the 50 per cent level. This could mislead observers into overestimating the inclination i between disc and sky planes. Because RCs require a correction factor of 1/sin i, the actual RC could be much higher than that reported by observers. This plausibly reconciles AGC 114905 with MOND expectations.},

Reverberation time lags occur due to light travel time delays between changes in the direct coronal emission and corresponding variations in its reflection from the accretion flow. Reverberation is detectable using light curves made in different X-ray energy bands, since the direct and reflected components have different spectral shapes. Larger, lower frequency, lags are also seen and are identified with propagation of fluctuations through the accretion flow and associated corona. We review the evidence for X-ray reverberation in active galactic nuclei and black hole X-ray binaries, showing how it can be best measured and how it may be modelled. The timescales and energy dependence of the high-frequency reverberation lags show that much of the signal is originating from very close to the black hole in some objects, within a few gravitational radii of the event horizon. We consider how these signals can be studied in the future to carry out X-ray reverberation mapping of the regions closest to black holes.},

The time-averaged shape of the line can be explained most naturally by a combination of special and general relativistic effects. Such line profiles contain information about the black hole spin and the accretion disc, as well as the geometry of the emitting region, and may help to test general relativity in the strong gravity regime. In this paper we embark on the computation of the temporal response of the line to the illuminating flux. Previous studies concentrated on the calculation of reverberation signatures from static sources illuminating the disc. In this paper we focus on the more physically justified case of flares located above the accretion disc and corotating with it. We compute the time-dependent iron line, taking into account all general relativistic effects, and show that its shape is of a very complex nature, and we also present light curves accompanying the iron line variability. We suggest that present and future X-ray satellites like XMM or Constellation-X may be capable of detecting features present in the computed reverberation maps.},

accreting gas is illuminated by an X-ray source located on the rotation
axis of the black hole. The spectroscopic features imprinted in the
reflection component are modelled using REFLIONX. The associated time
delays after the direct continuum, known as reverberation lags, are
computed including the full effects of dilution and ionization gradients
on the disc. We perform, for the first time, simultaneous fitting of the
time-averaged and lag-energy spectra in three AGN: Mrk 335, IRAS
13224-3809 and Ark 564 observed with XMM-Newton. The best-fitting source
height and central mass of each AGN partly agree with those previously
reported. We find that including the ionization gradient in the model
naturally explains lag-energy observations in which the 3 keV and 7-10
keV bands precede other bands. To obtain the clear 3 keV and 7-10 keV
dips in the lag-energy profile, the model requires either a source
height {\textgreater}5 rg, or a disc that is highly ionized at small
radii and is colder further out. We also show that fitting the lag or
the mean spectra alone can lead to different results and
interpretations. This is therefore important to combine the spectral and
timing data in order to find the plausible but self-consistent fits
which are achievable with our model.},

	abstract = {X-ray reverberation echoes are assumed to be produced in the strongly distorted spacetime around accreting supermassive black holes. This signal allows us to spatially map the geometry of the inner accretion flow1,2—a region that cannot yet be spatially resolved by any telescope—and provides a direct measure of the black hole mass and spin. The reverberation timescale is set by the light travel path between the direct emission from a hot X-ray corona and the reprocessed emission from the inner edge of the accretion disk3–6. However, there is an inherent degeneracy in the reverberation signal between black hole mass, inner disk radius and height of the illuminating corona above the disk. Here we use a long X-ray observation of the highly variable active galaxy IRAS 13224−3809 to track the reverberation signal as the system evolves on timescales of a day7,8. With the inclusion of all the relativistic effects, modelling reveals that the height of the X-ray corona increases with increasing luminosity, providing a dynamic view of the inner accretion region. This simultaneous modelling allows us to break the inherent degeneracies and obtain an independent timing-based estimate for the mass and spin of the black hole. The uncertainty on black hole mass is comparable to the leading optical reverberation method9, making X-ray reverberation a powerful technique, particularly for sources with low optical variability10.},

	abstract = {The illumination pattern (or emissivity profile) of the accretion disc due to the reflection of X-rays in active galactic nucleus can be understood in terms of relativistic effects on the rays propagating from a source in a corona surrounding the central black hole, both on their trajectories and on the accretion disc itself. Theoretical emissivity profiles due to isotropic point sources as well as simple extended geometries are computed in general relativistic ray-tracing simulations performed on graphics processing units (GPUs). Such simulations assuming only general relativity naturally explain the accretion disc emissivity profiles determined from relativistically broadened emission lines which fall off steeply (with power-law indices of between 6 and 8) over the inner regions of the disc, then flattening off to almost a constant before tending to a constant power law of index 3 over the outer disc. Simulations for a variety of source locations, extents and geometries show how the emissivity profiles depend on these properties, and when combined with reverberation time lags allow the location and extent of the primary X-ray source to be constrained. Comparing the emissivity profile determined from the broadened iron K emission line in spectra of 1H 0707-495 obtained in 2008 January to theoretical emissivity profiles and applying constraints from reverberation lags suggest that there exists an extended region of primary X-ray emission located as low as 2rg above the accretion disc, extending outwards to a radius of around 30rg.},

	abstract = {Black hole-neutron star (BHNS) binaries are expected to be among the leading sources of gravitational waves observable by ground-based detectors, and may be the progenitors of short-hard gamma ray bursts (SGRBs) as well. Here, we discuss our new fully general relativistic calculations of merging BHNS binaries, which use high-accuracy, low-eccentricity, conformal thin-sandwich configurations as initial data. Our evolutions are performed using the moving puncture method and include a fully relativistic, high-resolution shock-capturing hydrodynamics treatment. Focusing on systems in which the neutron star is irrotational and the black hole is nonspinning with a 3:1 mass ratio, we investigate the inspiral, merger, and disk formation in the system. We find that the vast majority of material is promptly accreted and no more than 3\% of the neutron star's rest mass is ejected into a tenuous, gravitationally bound disk. We find similar results for mass ratios of 2:1 and 1:1, even when we reduce the NS compaction in the 2:1 mass ratio case. These ambient disks reach temperatures suitable for triggering SGRBs, but their masses may be too small to produce the required total energy output. We measure gravitational waveforms and compute the effective strain in frequency space, finding measurable differences between our waveforms and those produced by binary black hole mergers within the advanced LIGO band. These differences appear at frequencies corresponding to the emission that occurs when the NS is tidally disrupted and accreted by the black hole. The resulting information about the radius of the neutron star may be used to constrain the neutron star equation of state.},

	abstract = {A disformal Kerr black hole solution is a rotating black hole solution in a modified gravity theory which breaks the circular condition of spacetime differently from the case of the Kerr spacetime. In this paper, assuming that Sagittarius A* (Sgr A*) is a disformal Kerr black hole, we examine the potential to test the spacetime geometry with a hypothetical pulsar whose orbital elements are similar to those of the S2/S0-2 star. By numerically solving the equations of motion for the pulsar and photons emitted from it, we calculate the apparent position of the pulsar and the time of arrival (TOA) of the emitted pulse signals. Our analysis shows that the magnitude of the difference in the TOAs reaches the order of \$10{\textbackslash}{\textgreater}\{{\textbackslash}rm ms\}\$ if the deviation from the Kerr spacetime is significant. The time difference is mainly caused by the non-circularity of the spacetime at the \$1.5\$ post-Newtonian order. The accuracy of the TOA measurement by a future radio telescope named the Square Kilometer Array (SKA) is between about \$0.1{\textbackslash}{\textgreater}\{{\textbackslash}rm ms\}\$ and \$10{\textbackslash}{\textgreater}\{{\textbackslash}rm ms\}\$ for a normal pulsar. Thus, we expect that the SKA can distinguish the disformal Kerr black hole from the Kerr black hole through the non-circularity of the spacetime around Sgr A*.},

However, solutions for the metric that allow for analytic computations are not always available. We implement a hybrid analytic-numerical approximation to determine the deﬂection angle in static, spherically symmetric spacetimes. We apply this to a set of numerical black hole solutions within the class of theories known as Degenerate Higher Order Scalar-tensor Theories. Comparing our results to a more time consuming full numerical integration, we ﬁnd that we can accurately describe the deﬂection angle for light rays passing at arbitrary distances from the photon sphere with a combination of two analytic-numerical approximations. Furthermore, we ﬁnd a range of parameters where our DHOST black holes predict strong lensing eﬀects whose size is comparable with the uncertainty in the properties of the supermassive black hole in M87 reported by the Event Horizon Telescope, showing that strong lensing is a viable alternative to put constraints on these models.},

This study investigated the dynamic behaviors of the motion of timelike particles in such disformal black-hole spacetime with an extra deformation parameter. Results showed that the characteristics of the particle's motion depend on the sign of the deformation parameter. For the positive deformation parameter, the motion is regular and orderly. For the negative one, as the deformation parameter changes, the motion of the particles undergoes a series of transitions between the chaotic motion and the regular motion and falls into the horizon or escapes to spatial infinity. This means that the dynamic behavior of timelike particles in the disformal Kerr black-hole spacetime with noncircularity becomes richer than that in the usual Kerr black-hole case.},

Our result show that the size of the shadow increases with the deformation parameter for the black hole with arbitrary spin parameter. However, the effect of the deformation parameter on the shadow shape depends heavily on the spin parameter of black hole and the sign of the deformation parameter. The change of the shadow shape becomes more distinct for the black hole with the more quickly rotation and the more negative deformation parameter. Especially, for the near-extreme black hole with negative deformation parameter, there exist a “pedicel”like structure appeared in the shadow, which increases with the absolute value of deformation parameter. The eyebrowlike shadow and the self-similar fractal structures also appear in the shadow for the disformal Kerr black hole in DHOST theory. These features in the black hole shadow originating from the scalar ﬁeld could help us to understand the nonstealth disformal Kerr black hole and quadratic DHOST theory.},

	abstract = {Using the disformal solution-generating method, we construct new axisymmetric solutions in Degenerate Higher Order Scalar Tensor (DHOST) theories. The method consists in first considering a “seed” known solution in DHOST theories and then performing a disformal transformation of the metric to obtain a new solution. In vacuum, the two solutions are equivalent but they become physically inequivalent when one considers coupling to matter. In that way, we “disform” the stealth Kerr black hole solution and we obtain a first analytic rotating non-stealth solution in DHOST theories, while the associated scalar field is time-dependent with a constant kinetic density. The new solution is characterized by three parameters: the mass, the spin and the disformal parameter which encodes the deviation with respect to the Kerr geometry. We explore some geometrical properties of the novel disformed Kerr geometry which is no more Ricci flat but has the same singularity as the Kerr metric, admits an ergoregion, and is asymptotically flat. Moreover, the hidden symmetry of the Kerr solution is broken, providing an example of a non-circular geometry in a higher order theory of gravity. We also discuss geodesic motions and compute its (disformed) null directions which are interesting tools to understand the causal structure of the geometry. In addition, to illustrate again the potentiality of the disformal solution-generating method, we present another axisymmetric solution for DHOST theories obtained from a disformal transformation of the generalized Kerr solution of Einstein-Scalar gravity.},

In this work, we explore the possibility to use disformal field redefinitions to investigate new regions of the solution space of DHOST theories, and present new hairy black holes solutions beyond the stealth sector. The crucial ingredient is to find suitable seed solutions to generate new exact ones for DHOST theories. We first consider a seed solution of the Einstein-Scalar system describing a naked singularity. Under suitable assumptions, we derive a no-go result showing that no black hole solution can be constructed from such a seed GR solution. Then, taking into account the stability of each degeneracy classes of quadratic DHOST theories under a general disformal mapping, we consider two kinds of known black hole solutions as seed configurations: the Schwarzschild stealth solution and the non-stealth Reissner-Nordstrom like solution. Restricting our considerations to invertible disformal transformations, we show that building new hairy black hole solutions from the stealth solution associated to a constant kinetic term is also quite constrained. We obtain new solutions which either are stealth or describe asymptotically locally flat black holes with a deficit solid angle. However, starting from the non-stealth seed solution associated to a non constant kinetic term as well as a time-dependent scalar profile, we show that a disformal transformation can introduce rather general modifications of the exterior geometry. Finally, we consider the construction of minimally modified hairy black hole solutions using a small disformal transformation. Further applications of this solution generating method should allow to provide new hairy rotating black hole solutions beyond the stealth sector, as well as minimally modified GR solutions useful for phenomenological investigations of compact objects beyond GR.},

We discuss some properties of black holes in this framework and investigate in detail the properties of neutron stars, both static and in slow rotation. We find that for relatively modest deviations from general relativity, the secondary object in GW190814 is compatible with being a slowly-rotating neutron star, without resorting to very stiff or exotic equations of state. Remarkably, the equilibrium sequence of neutron stars matches asymptotically to the black hole limit, completetly closing the mass gap between neutron stars and black holes of same radius, although the stability of equilibrium solutions has yet to be determined. As a consequence, there exists a universal endpoint for the neutron star sequence, independent of the equation of state. In light of our results and of current observational constraints, we discuss specific constraints on the coupling constant that parametrizes deviations from general relativity in this theory.},

Non-circularity has far reaching consequences on the structure of the solution. As we approach the rotating compact object from asymptotic inﬁnity we ﬁnd a static limit ergosurface similar to the Kerr spacetime with an enclosed ergoregion. However, the stationary limit of infalling observers is found to be a timelike hypersurface. A candidate event horizon is found in the interior of this stationary limit surface. It is a null hypersurface generated by a null congruence of light rays which are no longer Killing vectors. Under a mild regularity assumption, we ﬁnd that the candidate surface is indeed an event horizon and the disformed Kerr metric is therefore a black hole quite distinct from the Kerr solution.},

	abstract = {In this pilot study, we investigate the use of a deep learning (DL) model to temporally evolve the dynamics of gas accreting onto a black hole in the form of a radiatively ineﬃcient accretion ﬂow (RIAF). We have trained a convolutional neural network (CNN) on a dataset which consists of numerical solutions of the hydrodynamical equations, for a range of initial conditions. We ﬁnd that deep neural networks trained on one simulation seem to learn reasonably well the spatiotemporal distribution of densities and mass continuity of a black hole accretion ﬂow over a duration of 8 × 104𝐺 𝑀/𝑐3, comparable to the viscous timescale at 𝑟 = 400𝐺 𝑀/𝑐2; after that duration, the model drifts from the ground truth suﬀering from excessive artiﬁcial mass injection. Models trained on simulations with diﬀerent initial conditions show some promise of generalizing to conﬁgurations not present in the training set, but also suﬀer from mass continuity issues. We discuss the caveats behind this method and the potential beneﬁts that DL models oﬀer. For instance, once trained the model evolves a RIAF on a single GPU four orders of magnitude faster than usual ﬂuid dynamics integrators running in parallel on 200 CPU cores. We speculate that a data-driven machine learning approach should be very promising for accelerating simulations of accreting black holes.},

	abstract = {We describe IPOLE, a new public ray-tracing code for covariant, polarized radiative transport. The code extends the IBOTHROS scheme for covariant, unpolarized transport using two representations of the polarized radiation ﬁeld: In the coordinate frame, it parallel transports the coherency tensor; in the frame of the plasma it evolves the Stokes parameters under emission, absorption, and Faraday conversion. The transport step is implemented to be as spacetime- and coordinate- independent as possible. The emission, absorption, and Faraday conversion step is implemented using an analytic solution to the polarized transport equation with constant coefﬁcients. As a result, IPOLE is stable, efﬁcient, and produces a physically reasonable solution even for a step with high optical depth and Faraday depth. We show that the code matches analytic results in ﬂat space, and that it produces results that converge to those produced by Dexter’s GRTRANS polarized transport code on a complicated model problem. We expect IPOLE will mainly ﬁnd applications in modelling Event Horizon Telescope sources, but it may also be useful in other relativistic transport problems such as modelling for the IXPE mission.},

	abstract = {We perform the ﬁrst systematic search of all NICER archival observations of black hole (and candidate) low-mass X-ray binaries for signatures of reverberation. Reverberation lags result from the light travel time diﬀerence between the direct coronal emission and the reﬂected disk component, and therefore their properties are a useful probe of the disk-corona geometry. We detect new signatures of reverberation lags in 8 sources, increasing the total sample from 3 to 11, and study the evolution of reverberation lag properties as the sources evolve in outbursts. We ﬁnd that in all of the 9 sources with more than 1 reverberation lag detection, the reverberation lags become longer and dominate at lower Fourier frequencies during the hard-to-soft state transition. This result shows that the evolution in reverberation lags is a global property of the state transitions of black hole low-mass X-ray binaries, which is valuable in constraining models of such state transitions. The reverberation lag evolution suggests that the corona is the base of a jet which vertically expands and/or gets ejected during state transition. We also discover that in the hard state, the reverberation lags get shorter, just as the QPOs move to higher frequencies, but then in the state transition, while the QPOs continue to higher frequencies, the lags get longer. We discuss implications for the coronal geometry and physical models of QPOs in light of this new ﬁnding.},

	abstract = {We study reflected X-ray emission that returns to the accretion disc in the strong gravitational fields around black holes using General Relativistic ray-tracing and radiative transfer calculations. Reflected X-rays that are produced when the inner regions of the disc are illuminated by the corona are subject to strong gravitational light bending, causing up to 47 per cent of the reflected emission to be returned to the disc around a rapidly spinning black hole, depending upon the scale height of the corona. The iron Kα line is enhanced relative to the continuum by 25 per cent, and the Compton hump by up to a factor of 3. Additional light traveltime between primary and secondary reflections increases the reverberation time lag measured in the iron K band by 49 per cent, while the soft X-ray lag is increased by 25 per cent and the Compton hump response time is increased by 60 per cent. Measured samples of X-ray reverberation lags are shown to be consistent with X-rays returning to the accretion disc in strong gravity. Understanding the effects of returning radiation is important in interpreting reverberation observations to probe black holes. Reflected X-rays returning to the disc can be uniquely identified by blueshifted returning iron K line photons that are Compton scattered from the inner disc, producing excess, delayed emission in the 3.5-4.5 keV energy range that will be detectable with forthcoming X-ray observatories, representing a unique test of General Relativity in the strong field limit.},

	abstract = {Accreting black holes show characteristic features that result from reprocessing of hard X-ray photons by the accretion disk. The shape of these features depends on the properties of the accretion disc and the black holes. Even though X-ray 'reflection' energy spectra have been extensively modelled to constrain the geometry of these systems and the spin of black holes, X-ray reverberation mapping lacks from the same accuracy in modelling. Here we present the reltrans model that aims to self-consistently explain the reverberation time lags observed in accreting black holes together with other different sources of lags probably connected to the mass accretion rate in the disc. We show the importance of introducing a radial ionisation profile in the disk and how this can change the lag energy spectrum. We applied our model on both black hole binaries (Cygnus X-1 and MAXI J1820+070) and supermassive black holes (Mrk 335) constraining the accretion disc parameters and measuring the black hole mass. We show the interesting comparison between these two classes of systems.},

Reverberation mapping is a tomographical method for studying the kinematics and geometry of the broad-line region of active galactic nuclei at high spatial resolution. Leveraging modern image reconstruction techniques, including total variation and compressed sensing, TLDR applies multiple regularization schemes to reconstruct velocity delay maps using the alternating direction method of multipliers. Along with the detailed description of the TLDR algorithm we present test reconstructions from TLDR applied to synthetic reverberation mapping spectra as well as a preliminary reconstruction of the Hβ feature of Arp 151 from the 2008 Lick Active Galactic Nuclei Monitoring Project.},

We confirm the previous discovery of reverberation lags in the hard state, and find that the frequency range where the (soft) reverberation lag dominates decreases with the reverberation lag amplitude increasing during the transition, suggesting an increasing X-ray emitting region, possibly due to an expanding corona. By jointly fitting the lag-energy spectra in a number of broad frequency ranges with the reverberation model reltrans, we find the increase in reverberation lag is best described by an increase in the X-ray coronal height. This result, along with the finding that the corona contracts in the hard state, suggests a close relationship between spatial extent of the X-ray corona and the radio jet. We find the corona expansion (as probed by reverberation) precedes a radio flare by ∼5 days, which may suggest that the hard-to-soft transition is marked by the corona expanding vertically and launching a jet knot that propagates along the jet stream at relativistic velocities.},

	abstract = {Accreting, stellar-mass black holes are anything but predictable. A new study explores whats happening as these feeding monsters erupt in violent outbursts and then settle down again.This illustration shows some of the possible transient behavior of the gas flowing onto and away from a black hole in an X-ray binary. [NASA/JPL-Caltech]An Unsteady ExistenceBlack hole X-ray binaries (BHXBs) consist of a stellar-mass black hole that siphons material from an ordinary companion star. As this material flows between the objects, it forms an accretion disk around the black hole. BHXBs shine in X-rays from the hot material of this disk, and from a mysterious corona ultra-hot gas that exists in some unknown form above the disk.BHXBs may accrete quietly and steadily much of the time, but on occasion, they undergo sudden outbursts, substantially brightening in X-rays. Unlike supermassive black holes, which evolve on extremely long timescales, stellar-mass black holes can change over just days or weeks short enough for us to watch!In a new study led by Jingyi Wang (MIT Kavli Institute), a team of scientists presents observations by NICER an X-ray telescope installed on the International Space Station of a BHXB throwing such a temper tantrum.Reflections of a TransitionDuring an outburst, a BHXB undergoes state transitions, displaying changes in the X-ray luminosities and energies as either the corona or the disk takes over to dominate the emission. In addition to the X-ray changes, persistent radio emission from a slow and steady jet can be suddenly replaced by a short-lived radio flare that then subsides.Despite many observations, we lack the details of whats happening on small scales, close around the black hole. What form does the corona take? Does its size or extent change over time? What drives the state transitions? And how are the different components of this system disk, corona, and jet related, if at all?The top plot (a) shows the inferred corona height (black line) over the span of the outburst. The radio emission, including the flare, can be seen in red. The bottom two diagrams show the authors picture of the geometry of the black hole, disk, and corona at two points during the state changes: during the rise from quiescence (b), and at the end of the outburst when the jet base is ejected (c). Click to enlarge. [Adapted from Wang et al. 2021]Wang and collaborators used NICER data of the BHXB system MAXI J1820+070 during a 2018 outburst to track the lag caused by light travel time between X-rays that arrived directly from the corona and light from the corona that was reflected by the disk before reaching us. By modeling the changes in this reverberation lag as the system underwent state transitions, the team could infer the geometry on the small scales we cant observe, helping us to understand the tantrum.A Connected PictureWang and collaborators show that the best explanation of NICERs observations is that the height of the X-ray corona changes during the BHXBs state transitions. They argue that the corona first contracts, and then rapidly expands during the outburst, preceding a radio flare by {\textasciitilde}5 days.Under the authors interpretation, these signs point to a neat picture of BHXB outbursts: a quietly accreting black hole has a disk and a steady jet, and the corona makes up the base of that jet. When the BHXB goes into outburst, it ejects that jet base as a bright knot in its final moments of outburst, before fading back to quiescence.While this model isnt yet definitive, this latest evidence points to a clear connection between the disk, jet, and corona of a BHXB.

Our results suggest that the thermal reverberation effects should be stronger in sources with large X-ray source height and low accretion rate. We found that time lags increase with height and accretion rate. The amplitude of the observed time lags as a function of wavelength (in NGC 5548) is consistent with the model predictions. It is not necessary for the disc to be too hot, it may be that the X-ray source is located further from the disc.},

	abstract = {Supermassive black holes in an active accretion mode display characteristic features that result from reprocessing of hard X-ray photons by the accretion disk. Spectral analysis shows distortions of the spectral features due to the relativistic effects close to the black hole, while timing analysis probes time lags due to the different path length covered by photons from the primary source and those which are reflected off the accretion disk. The former constrains the geometry of the system, but it is independent of the mass. The latter depends on the mass since it sets the scale of the system. We developed a model that simultaneously constrains all these characteristics self-consistently. We applied our new spectral-timing model (reltrans) to a sample of Seyfert galaxies fitting the flux-energy spectrum and the reverberation lags as a function of energy. We show that the constraints derived from the usual spectral fitting change once we consider the timing properties of the system. We demonstrate that this simultaneous spectral and timing fit is sensitive to the mass of the black hole, and we compare our results with independent measurements.},

	abstract = {Accreting black holes such as those in X-ray binaries and active galactic nuclei, often show signatures of time lags between different X-ray bands. Hard lags are typically associated with fluctuations in the accretion flow, while soft lags are explained by the light-crossing time between the corona and the disk (reverberation). The radiation component reprocessed in the disk, which shows characteristic reflection features such as the iron K emission, is commonly assumed to respond instantaneously to any variability in the corona. Here we explore a new source of soft lags caused by the time that reflected photons take to diffuse in the hot layers of the illuminated accretion disk. By only considering electron scattering, we estimate the time spent by the random walk of photons in the disk atmosphere. We show that this process, which is a function of the gas density, increases the X-ray lags and can produce an enhancement of the reverberation signal in the lag-energy spectrum. We argue that this process is responsible for the apparent discrepancy observed in the strength of the reflection component required by current models to reproduce both the lag-energy and flux-energy spectra.},

	abstract = {Accreting black holes commonly exhibit hard X-ray emission, originating from a compact region of hot plasma commonly referred to as the corona. What powers the corona is unknown, but some models suggest the corona is related to the base of a relativistic jet. In this talk, I will disucss this jet model in the context of X-ray variability. In particular, in recent years a new tool for probing the geometry of the corona has been developed, called X-ray reverberation mapping. Some of the coronal photons irradiate the accretion flow and are reprocessed; due to differences in light travel time, the reprocessed photons lag behind those reaching us directly from the corona. While reverberation lags are now commonly detected in X-ray binaries, our models remain overly simplistic, modeling the X-ray corona as a simple point source of light. I will discuss recent efforts to move beyond this simple paradigm, with the goal of accounting for the full spatial extent of the corona. In particular, I will highlight the impact that the fully self consistent inclusion of a second lamppost, mimicking a vertically extended corona similar to the base of a jet. I will also discuss an application of this new model to new NICER observations of black hole outbursts, and discuss implications on the inferred properties of the accretion flow, black hole mass and spin.},

In magnetized fusion plasma community, most ray tracing codes assume the plasma density and temperature be functions of the magnetic flux and study waves only inside the last closed flux surface, which are sufficient for the present day tokamak. However, they are difficult to be used for configurations with open magnetic field line plasmas, such as mirror machine and field-reversed-configuration (FRC). We develop a ray tracing code in cylindrical coordinates (r , ϕ , z) to support arbitrary axisymmetric configurations with both closed and open field lines plasmas. For wave propagation, the cold plasma dispersion relation is usually sufficient, and we require the magnetic field B (r , z) and species densities ns0 (r , z) profiles as input. For wave absorption, we require a further temperature Ts0 (r , z) profile to solve a hot kinetic plasma dispersion relation. In difference to other ray tracing codes which calculate the imaginary part of wave vector k⊥,i for wave absorption, we calculate the imaginary part of wave frequency ωi, which is shown to be equivalent with the former technique under weak damping approximation. The code can use either numerical or analytical equilibrium. Examples and benchmarks with electron cyclotron wave, lower hybrid wave and ion cyclotron wave for tokamak, spherical tokamak (ST), FRC and mirror machine are shown.},

Here we report on tests of the consistency and accuracy of the general relativistic radiative transfer codes used within the collaboration to model M87* and Sgr A*. We compare and evaluate (1) deﬂection angles for equatorial null geodesics in a Kerr spacetime; (2) images calculated from a series of simple, parameterized matter distributions in the Kerr metric using simpliﬁed emissivities and absorptivities; (3) for a subset of codes, images calculated from general relativistic magnetohydrodynamics simulations using different realistic synchrotron emissivities and absorptivities; (4) observables for the 2017 conﬁguration of EHT, including visibility amplitudes and closure phases. The error in total ﬂux is of order 1\% when the codes are run with production numerical parameters. The dominant source of discrepancies for small camera distances is the location and detailed setup of the software “camera” that each code uses to produce synthetic images. We ﬁnd that when numerical parameters are suitably chosen and the camera is sufﬁciently far away the images converge and that for given transfer coefﬁcients, numerical uncertainties are unlikely to limit parameter estimation for the current generation of EHT observations. The purpose of this paper is to describe a veriﬁcation and comparison of EHT radiative transfer codes. It is not to verify EHT models more generally.},

	abstract = {Light bending by the strong gravity around the black hole will form the so-called black hole shadow, the shape of which can shed light on the structure of the near-horizon geometry to possibly reveal novel physics of strong gravity and black hole. In this work, we adopt both analytical and ray-tracing methods to study the black hole shadow in the presence of the infrared structure of gravity theory, which manifests the asymptotic symmetries of spacetime as the supertranslation soft hairs of the black hole. Though the black hole metrics with and without the soft hair are related by large gauge transformations, the near horizon geometries relevant for the shape of the shadow are quite different. Moreover, the Hamiltonian for the geodesic seems intrinsically different, i.e., the loss of separability due to the breaking of spherical symmetry by soft hair. By applying ray-tracing computations, we find that the soft hair, although not affecting the shape of the shadow, may change the average size and position of the shadow. Images resulting from soft hair black holes with surrounding accretion flows are also discussed.},

Astrid statistically models BH gas accretion and active galactic nucleus (AGN) feedback to their environments, applies a power-law distribution for BH seed mass \${\textbackslash}, M\_\{{\textbackslash}rm sd\}\$, uses a dynamical friction model for BH dynamics, and executes a physical treatment of BH mergers. The BH population is broadly consistent with empirical constraints on the BH mass function, the bright end of the luminosity functions, and the time evolution of BH mass and accretion rate density. The BH mass and accretion exhibit a tight correlation with host stellar mass and star formation rate. We trace BHs seeded before z {\textgreater} 10 down to z = 3, finding that BHs carry virtually no imprint of the initial \${\textbackslash}, M\_\{{\textbackslash}rm sd\}\$ except those with the smallest \${\textbackslash}, M\_\{{\textbackslash}rm sd\}\$, where less than 50 per cent of them have doubled in mass. Gas accretion is the dominant channel for BH growth compared to BH mergers. With dynamical friction, Astrid predicts a significant delay for BH mergers after the first encounter of a BH pair, with a typical elapse time of about 200 Myr. There are in total 4.5 × 105 BH mergers in Astrid at z {\textgreater} 3, {\textasciitilde}103 of which have X-ray detectable EM counterparts: a bright \${\textbackslash}, \{{\textbackslash}rm kpc\}\$ scale dual AGN with LX {\textgreater} 1043 erg s-1.

I Zwicky 1 (I Zw 1) is a nearby narrow-line Seyfert 1 galaxy7,8. Previous studies of the reverberation of X-rays from its accretion disk revealed that the corona is composed of two components: an extended, slowly varying component extending over the surface of the inner accretion disk, and a collimated core, with luminosity fluctuations propagating upwards from its base, which dominates the more rapid variability9,10. Here we report observations of X-ray flares emitted from around the supermassive black hole in I Zw 1. X-ray reflection from the accretion disk is detected through a relativistically broadened iron K line and Compton hump in the X-ray emission spectrum. Analysis of the X-ray flares reveals short flashes of photons consistent with the re-emergence of emission from behind the black hole. The energy shifts of these photons identify their origins from different parts of the disk11,12. These are photons that reverberate off the far side of the disk, and are bent around the black hole and magnified by the strong gravitational field. Observing photons bent around the black hole confirms a key prediction of general relativity.},

While most properties are generally explained in the truncated disc/hot inner flow model, the detection of a broad residual around the iron line argues for strong relativistic effects from an untruncated disc. Since spectral fitting alone is somewhat degenerate, we combine it with the additional information in the fast X-ray variability and perform a full spectral-timing analysis for NICER and NuSTAR data on a bright low/hard state of MAXI J1820+070. We model the variability with propagating mass accretion rate fluctuations by combining two separate current insights: that the hot flow is spectrally inhomogeneous, and that there is a discontinuous jump in viscous time-scale between the hot flow and variable disc. Our model naturally gives the double-humped shape of the power spectra, and the increasing high-frequency variability with energy in the second hump. Including reflection and reprocessing from a disc truncated at a few tens of gravitational radii quantitatively reproduces the switch in the lag-frequency spectra, from hard lagging soft at low frequencies (propagation through the variable flow) to the soft lagging hard at the high frequencies (reverberation from the hard X-ray continuum illuminating the disc). The viscous time-scale of the hot flow is derived from the model, and we show how this can be used to observationally test ideas about the origin of the jet.},

We observe that our proposed shape function connects two asymptotically flat regions, which shows the existence of Morris–Thorne traversable wormhole. Moreover, we also represent the embedding diagram in three-dimensional Euclidean space which can be extended from throat to infinity. Further, the Null and Weak energy conditions are discussed in detail. With this shape function, the anisotropic factor exhibits a repulsive nature at the throat. We support all the analysis of this work through graphical representation.

CAMELS is a suite of 4,233 cosmological simulations of (25 h−1Mpc)3 volume each: 2,184 state-of-the-art (magneto-)hydrodynamic simulations run with the AREPO and GIZMO codes, employing the same baryonic subgrid physics as the IllustrisTNG and SIMBA simulations, and 2,049 N-body simulations. The goal of the CAMELS project is to provide theory predictions for diﬀerent observables as a function of cosmology and astrophysics, and it is the largest suite of cosmological (magneto-)hydrodynamic simulations designed to train machine learning algorithms. CAMELS contains thousands of diﬀerent cosmological and astrophysical models by way of varying Ωm, σ8, and four parameters controlling stellar and AGN feedback, following the evolution of more than 100 billion particles and ﬂuid elements over a combined volume of (400 h−1Mpc)3. We describe the simulations in detail and characterize the large range of conditions represented in terms of the matter power spectrum, cosmic star-formation rate density, galaxy stellar mass function, halo baryon fractions, and several galaxy scaling relations. We show that the IllustrisTNG and SIMBA suites produce roughly similar distributions of galaxy properties over the full parameter space but signiﬁcantly diﬀerent halo baryon fractions and baryonic eﬀects on the matter power spectrum. This emphasizes the need for marginalizing over baryonic eﬀects to extract the maximum amount of information from cosmological surveys. We illustrate the unique potential of CAMELS using several machine learning applications, including non-linear interpolation, parameter estimation, symbolic regression, data generation with Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), dimensionality reduction, and anomaly detection.},

We employ Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), architectures designed to work with irregular and sparse data, like the distribution of galaxies in the Universe. We first show that GNNs can learn to compute the power spectrum of galaxy catalogues with a few percent accuracy. We then train GNNs to perform likelihood-free inference at the galaxy-field level. Our models are able to infer the value of \${\textbackslash}Omega\_\{{\textbackslash}rm m\}\$ with a \${\textbackslash}sim12{\textbackslash}\%-13{\textbackslash}\%\$ accuracy just from the positions of \${\textbackslash}sim1000\$ galaxies in a volume of \$(25{\textasciitilde}h{\textasciicircum}\{-1\}\{{\textbackslash}rm Mpc\}){\textasciicircum}3\$ at \$z=0\$ while accounting for astrophysical uncertainties as modelled in CAMELS. Incorporating information from galaxy properties, such as stellar mass, stellar metallicity, and stellar radius, increases the accuracy to \$4{\textbackslash}\%-8{\textbackslash}\%\$. Our models are built to be translational and rotational invariant, and they can extract information from any scale larger than the minimum distance between two galaxies.

	abstract = {X-ray reﬂection from an accretion disc produces characteristic emission lines allowing us to probe the innermost regions in AGN. We investigate these emission lines under a framework of Riemannian geometrical optics where the corona has a refractive index of n = 1. The empty space outside is a vacuum with n = 1. The Kerr metric is modiﬁed to trace the light rays that are bent due to not only the gravity of the black hole, but also the eﬀects of coronal plasma dependent on n. The choice of n alters the null geodesics, producing the eﬀect which is analogous to the light deﬂection. For the corona with n {\textgreater} 1, the disc on the far side within the corona covers a larger area on the observer’s sky, enhancing the blue wing of the line and producing more ﬂux diﬀerence between the blue peak and extended red tail. The inverse eﬀects are seen when n {\textless} 1. Moreover, the corona with n {\textgreater} 1 and n {\textless} 1 could induce extra shifts in the blue wing (∆gmax) to higher and lower energy, respectively. These eﬀects are more prominent when the inclination angle is 60◦ and the corona extends to 5rg. To obtain the deviation of the line shift of ∆gmax 0.01, the diﬀerence between the refractive index of the corona and that of the empty space must be ∆n 0.5\%. Finally, the lensing corona can inﬂuence the arrival time of photons that may aﬀect the observed variability of these emission lines.},

The polarization and the magnetization depend linearly on both electric and magnetic fields, and are the sum of a zero-temperature and zero-density vacuum part with a temperature- and chemical-potential-dependent medium part. Analytic calculations lead to generalized expressions that depend on three scalar functions. In the nonrelativistic limit, results reproduce the Lindhard formula. In the relativistic case, and in the long wavelength limit, we obtain the following: (i) for ω=0, generalized susceptibilities that reduce to known nonrelativistic limits; (ii) for ω≠0, Drude-type responses at zero temperature. The latter implies that both the electric permittivity ε and the magnetic permeability μ may be simultaneously negative, a behavior characteristic of metamaterials. This unambiguously indicates that the relativistic electron gas is one of nature’s candidates for the realization of a negative index of refraction system. Moreover, Maxwell’s equations in the medium yield the dispersion relation and the index of refraction of the electron gas. Present results should be relevant for plasma physics, astrophysical observations, synchrotrons, and other environments with fast-moving electrons.},

Here, we use general relativistic transfer functions for reflection of X-rays from a point source located at some height above the black hole to study the time lags expected as a function of frequency and energy in the Fe Kα line region. We explore the models and the dependence of the lags on key parameters such as the height of the X-ray source, accretion disc inclination, black hole spin and black hole mass. We then compare these models with the observed frequency- and energy-dependence of the Fe Kα line lag in NGC 4151. Assuming the optical reverberation mapping mass of 4.6 × 107 M⊙, we get a best fit to the lag profile across the Fe Kα line in the frequency range (1-2) × 10− 5 Hz for an X-ray source located at a height \$h = 7{\textasciicircum}\{+2.9\}\_\{-2.6\} R\_G\$ with a maximally spinning black hole and an inclination i \&lt; 30°.},

We analysed data from an XMM–Newton campaign covering the end of the transition from the soft to hard state, and the decrease of luminosity in the hard state. During all the observations we detected, at high frequencies, significant disc variability, responding to variations of the power-law emission with an average time delay of ∼0.009 ± 0.002 s. These new detections of disc thermal reverberation add to those previously obtained and suggest the lag to be always present in hard and hard-intermediate states. Our study reveals a net decrease of lag amplitude as a function of luminosity. We ascribe this trend to variations of the inner flow geometry. A possible scenario implies a decrease of the inner disc truncation radius as the luminosity increases at the beginning of the outburst, followed by an increase of the inner disc truncation radius as the luminosity decreases at the end of the outburst. Finally, we found hints of FeK reverberation (∼3σ significance) during the best quality observation of the XMM monitoring. The lag at the FeK energy has similar amplitude as that of the thermally reprocessed component, as expected if the same irradiated region of the disc is responsible for producing both the thermalized and reflected components. This finding suggests FeK reverberation in BHXRBs to be at the reach of current detectors provided observations of sufficiently long exposure are available.},

Here, we analyze a ∼100 ks archival XMM-Newton observation of the highly variable AGN, ESO 113−G010, in order to search for lags between hard, 1.5–4.5 keV, and soft, 0.3–0.9 keV, energy X-ray bands. At the lowest frequencies available in the light curve (≲ 1.5 × 10−4 Hz), we find hard lags where the power-law-dominated hard band lags the soft band (where the reflection fraction is high). However, at higher frequencies in the range (2–3) × 10−4 Hz we find a soft lag of −325 ± 89 s. The general evolution from hard to soft lags as the frequency increases is similar to other AGNs where soft lags have been detected. We interpret this soft lag as due to reverberation from the accretion disk, with the reflection component responding to variability from the X-ray corona. For a black hole mass of 7 × 106 M☉ this corresponds to a light-crossing time of ∼9 Rg/c; however, dilution effects mean that the intrinsic lag is likely longer than this. Based on recent black hole mass scaling for lag properties, the lag amplitude and frequency are more consistent with a black hole a few times more massive than the best estimates, though flux-dependent effects could easily add scatter this large.},

Here we measure and analyse the lags also between a harder X-ray band (4–7.5 keV) and the soft and medium bands, using existing XMM–Newton data, and demonstrate that the entire spectrum of lags, considering both the full energy range, 0.3–7.5 keV, and the full frequency range, 10−5≲ν≲ 10−2 Hz, are inconsistent with previous claims of arising as reverberation associated with the inner accretion disc. Instead we demonstrate that a simple reverberation model, in which scattering or reflection is present in all X-ray bands, explains the full set of lags without requiring any ad hoc explanation for the time lag sign changes. The range of time delays required to explain the observed lags extends up to about 1800 s in the hard band. The results are consistent with reverberation caused by scattering of X-rays passing through an absorbing medium whose opacity decreases with increasing energy and that partially covers the source. A high covering factor of absorbing and scattering circumnuclear material is inferred.},

	abstract = {The X-ray emission from active galactic nuclei (AGN) is highly variable. Measurements of time lags (characterized by lag spectra) between variability in the light curves in energy bands corresponding to directly observed continuum emission from the corona around the black hole and to X-rays reflected from the accretion disc add a further dimension to studies of the structure and energetics of these systems. We seek to understand these measurements in terms of the physical parameters of the X-ray source (its location, extent, etc.) through the calculation of theoretical lag spectra for a range of source parameters in general relativistic ray-tracing simulations, combined with the knowledge of the observed variability of the X-ray emission from AGN. Due to the proximity of the emission to the central black hole, Shapiro delays are important and the effects of general relativity should be considered when interpreting the lags as the light travel time between the source and reflector. We show that it is important to consider dilution of the lag by the contribution of both the primary and the reflected spectral components to the observed energy bands rather than observing pure continuum and reflected emission, reducing the measured lag by up to 75 per cent compared to the ‘intrinsic’ time lag due to light travel times. We find that the observed lag spectrum of the narrow-line Seyfert 1 galaxy 1H 0707−495 implies an X-ray source extending radially outwards to around 35rg and at a height of around 2rg above the plane of the accretion disc, consistent with the constraints obtained independently by considering the emissivity profile of the accretion disc. By investigating the influence of the propagation of X-ray luminosity fluctuations through the source region, we find it is possible to reproduce the shape of the low-frequency part of the lag spectrum (where the hard ‘primary’ band lags behind the soft ‘reflected’ band) as the effect of luminosity fluctuations originating in the centre of the X-ray source, close to the black hole, and propagating outwards.},

In most cases the detection of reverberation lags is hampered by low levels of variability-power signal-to-noise ratio (typically when the source is in a soft state) and/or short exposure times. The most detailed study was possible for GX 339-4 in the hard state, which allowed us to characterize the evolution of X-ray lags as a function of luminosity in a single source. Over all the sampled frequencies (∼0.05–9 Hz), we observe the hard lags intrinsic to the power-law component, already well known from previous RXTE studies. The XMM-Newton soft X-ray response allows us to detail the disk variability. At low frequencies (long timescales) the disk component always leads the power-law component. On the other hand, a soft reverberation lag (ascribable to thermal reprocessing) is always detected at high frequencies (short timescales). The intrinsic amplitude of the reverberation lag decreases as the source luminosity and the disk fraction increase. This suggests that the distance between the X-ray source and the region of the optically thick disk where reprocessing occurs gradually decreases as GX 339-4 rises in luminosity through the hard state, possibly as a consequence of reduced disk truncation.},

	abstract = {The first reverberation lag from the vicinity of a supermassive black hole was recently detected in the NLS1 galaxy 1H0707-495. We interpreted the lag as due to reflection from matter close to the black hole, within a few gravitational radii of the event horizon (an inner reflector). It has since been claimed by Miller et al. that the lag can be produced by more distant matter, at hundreds of gravitational radii (an outer reflector). Here, we critically explore their interpretation of the lag. The detailed energy dependence of the time lags between soft and hard energy bands is well modelled by an inner reflector using our previously published spectral model. A contrary claim by Miller et al. was obtained by not accounting for the blackbody component in the soft band. Soft lags can be produced by a large-scale outer reflector if several, implausible, conditions are met. An additional transfer function is required in the soft band corresponding to a region that is physically close to the continuum source, or lies close to our line of sight and subtends a small solid angle at the source, challenging the production of the observed spectrum. We show that the original inner reflector interpretation of reverberation very close to the black hole provides a self-consistent and robust model which explains the energy spectrum and timing properties, including the time delays, power spectra and the shape of the coherence function. Several of these properties are opposite to the predictions from a simple large-scale outer reflection model.},

	url = {https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2018arXiv180501242P},
	abstract = {Scattering in the ionized interstellar medium is commonly observed to be anisotropic, with theories of magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence explaining the anisotropy through a preferred magnetic field direction throughout the scattering regions. In particular, the line of sight to the Galactic Center supermassive black hole, Sgr A*, exhibits strong and anisotropic scattering, which dominates its observed size at wavelengths of a few millimeters and longer. Therefore, inferences of the intrinsic structure of {\textbackslash}sgra{\textbackslash} at these wavelengths are sensitive to the assumed scattering model. In addition, extrapolations of the scattering model from long wavelengths, at which its parameters are usually estimated, to 1.3 mm, where the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) seeks to image Sgr A* on Schwarzschild-radius scales, are also sensitive to the assumed scattering model. Past studies of Sgr A* have relied on simple Gaussian models for the scattering kernel that effectively presume an inner scale of turbulence far greater than the diffractive scale; this assumption is likely violated for Sgr A* at 1.3 mm. We develop a physically motivated model for anisotropic scattering, using a simplified model for MHD turbulence with a finite inner scale and a wandering transverse magnetic field direction. We explore several explicit analytic models for this wandering and derive the expected observational properties --- scatter broadening and refractive scintillation --- for each. For expected values of the inner scale, the scattering kernel for all models is markedly non-Gaussian at 1.3 mm but is straightforward to calculate and depends only weakly on the assumed model for the wandering of the magnetic field direction. On the other hand, in all models, the refractive substructure depends strongly on the wandering model and may be an important consideration in imaging Sgr A* with the EHT.},

This observation offers a new and clean gravitational test of the black-hole metric in the strong-field regime. We show analytically that spacetimes that deviate from the Kerr metric but satisfy weak-field tests can lead to large deviations in the predicted black-hole shadows that are inconsistent with even the current EHT measurements. We use numerical calculations of regular, parametric, non-Kerr metrics to identify the common characteristic among these different parametrizations that control the predicted shadow size. We show that the shadow-size measurements place significant constraints on deviation parameters that control the second post-Newtonian and higher orders of each metric and are, therefore, inaccessible to weak-field tests. The new constraints are complementary to those imposed by observations of gravitational waves from stellar-mass sources.},

	abstract = {In April 2019, the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) collaboration revealed the first image of the candidate super- massive black hole (SMBH) at the centre of the giant elliptical galaxy Messier 87 (M87). This event-horizon-scale image shows a ring of glowing plasma with a dark patch at the centre, which is interpreted as the shadow of the black hole. This breakthrough result, which represents a powerful confirmation of Einstein’s theory of gravity, or general relativity, was made possible by assembling a global network of radio telescopes operating at millimetre wavelengths that for the first time included the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA). The addition of ALMA as an anchor station has enabled a giant leap forward by increasing the sensitivity limits of the EHT by an order of magnitude, effectively turning it into an imaging array. The published image demonstrates that it is now possible to directly study the event horizon shadows of SMBHs via electromagnetic radiation, thereby transforming this elusive frontier from a mathematical concept into an astrophysical reality. The expansion of the array over the next few years will include new stations on different continents — and eventually satellites in space. This will provide progressively sharper and higher-fidelity images of SMBH candidates, and potentially even movies of the hot plasma orbiting around SMBHs. These improvements will shed light on the processes of black hole accretion and jet formation on event-horizon scales, thereby enabling more precise tests of general relativity in the truly strong field regime.},

	abstract = {Reynolds \& Begelman have recently proposed a model in which the broad and extremely redshifted iron line seen during a deep minimum of the light curve of the Seyfert 1 galaxy MCG–6-30-15 originates from matter spiralling into a Schwarzschild black hole, contrary to previous claims that the black hole may be spinning rapidly. Here we calculate in detail the Xray spectrum produced by their model using the full reﬂected continuum emission, including absorption features. This calculation takes into account the Doppler and relativistic effects. For the range of parameters that we consider, we ﬁnd that the spectrum should show a large photoelectric absorption edge of iron, which is not seen in the data. The absorption edge is a consequence of the line-emitting matter within the innermost stable orbit being highly ionized, and is largely independent of the parameters chosen for the model. If we restrict our attention to the 3–10 keV band we may effectively remove this absorption edge by ﬁtting a steeper power law, but this results in a signiﬁcant underprediction of the 0.4–0.5 keV ﬂux. We conclude that the data on MCG–6-30-15 are more consistent with the Kerr than the Schwarzschild model.},

The radial equation of motion determines the necessary conditions for photons emitted from \$r=r\_*\$ to escape to infinity, and the polar angle equation of motion further restricts the allowed region of photon motion. From these two conditions, we provide a method to visualize a two-dimensional photon impact parameter space that allows photons to escape to infinity, i.e., the escapable region.

In contrast, machine learning techniques have demonstrated promising results for forecasting chaotic systems purely from past time series measurements of system state variables (training data), without prior knowledge of the system dynamics. The motivation for this paper is the potential of machine learning for filling in the gaps in our underlying mechanistic knowledge that cause widely-used knowledge-based models to be inaccurate. Thus we here propose a general method that leverages the advantages of these two approaches by combining a knowledge-based model and a machine learning technique to build a hybrid forecasting scheme. Potential applications for such an approach are numerous (e.g., improving weather forecasting). We demonstrate and test the utility of this approach using a particular illustrative version of a machine learning known as reservoir computing, and we apply the resulting hybrid forecaster to a low-dimensional chaotic system, as well as to a high-dimensional spatiotemporal chaotic system. These tests yield extremely promising results in that our hybrid technique is able to accurately predict for a much longer period of time than either its machine-learning component or its model-based component alone.},

This review systematically surveys both current ways of generating/adapting the reservoirs and training diﬀerent types of readouts.

Also, for additive cellular automaton rules, reservoir features can be combined using Boolean operations, which provides a direct way for concept building and symbolic processing, and it is much more efﬁcient compared to state-of-the-art approaches.},

The additional loss function penalizes non-physical predictions without the need of any additional training data. This approach is demonstrated on a chaotic Lorenz system and a truncation of the Charney-DeVore system. Compared to the conventional ESNs, the physics-informed ESNs improve the predictability horizon by about two Lyapunov times. This approach is also shown to be robust with regard to noise.

	abstract = {Asteroid exploration has been attracting more attention in recent years. Nevertheless, we have just visited tens of asteroids while we have discovered more than one million bodies. As our current observation and knowledge should be biased, it is essential to explore multiple asteroids directly to better understand the remains of planetary building materials. One of the mission design solutions is utilizing asteroid flyby cycler trajectories with multiple Earth gravity assists. An asteroid flyby cycler trajectory design problem is a subclass of global trajectory optimization problems with multiple flybys, involving a trajectory optimization problem for a given flyby sequence and a combinatorial optimization problem to decide the sequence of the flybys. As the number of flyby bodies grows, the computation time of this optimization problem expands maliciously. This paper presents a new method to design asteroid flyby cycler trajectories utilizing a surrogate model constructed by deep neural networks approximating trajectory optimization results. Since one of the bottlenecks of machine learning approaches is to generate massive trajectory databases, we propose an efficient database generation strategy by introducing pseudo-asteroids satisfying the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker conditions. The numerical result applied to JAXA's DESTINY+ mission shows that the proposed method can significantly reduce the computational time for searching asteroid flyby sequences.},

The resulting neural controlled differential equation model is directly applicable to the general setting of partiallyobserved irregularly-sampled multivariate time series, and (unlike previous work on this problem) it may utilise memory-efﬁcient adjoint-based backpropagation even across observations.

	abstract = {The last decade has witnessed an experimental revolution in data science and machine learning, epitomised by deep learning methods. Indeed, many high-dimensional learning tasks previously thought to be beyond reach -- such as computer vision, playing Go, or protein folding -- are in fact feasible with appropriate computational scale. Remarkably, the essence of deep learning is built from two simple algorithmic principles: first, the notion of representation or feature learning, whereby adapted, often hierarchical, features capture the appropriate notion of regularity for each task, and second, learning by local gradient-descent type methods, typically implemented as backpropagation. While learning generic functions in high dimensions is a cursed estimation problem, most tasks of interest are not generic, and come with essential pre-defined regularities arising from the underlying low-dimensionality and structure of the physical world. This text is concerned with exposing these regularities through unified geometric principles that can be applied throughout a wide spectrum of applications. Such a 'geometric unification' endeavour, in the spirit of Felix Klein's Erlangen Program, serves a dual purpose: on one hand, it provides a common mathematical framework to study the most successful neural network architectures, such as CNNs, RNNs, GNNs, and Transformers. On the other hand, it gives a constructive procedure to incorporate prior physical knowledge into neural architectures and provide principled way to build future architectures yet to be invented.},

Researchers have started applying machine learning algorithms, particularly neural networks, to build data-driven surrogate models for geophysical flows. The performance of the neural network highly relies upon its architecture design and selection of other hyperparameters. These neural networks are usually manually designed through trial and error to maximize their performance. This often requires domain knowledge of the neural network as well as the problems of interest. This limitation can be addressed by using an evolutionary algorithm to automatically design architecture and select optimal hyperparameters of the neural network. In this paper, we apply the genetic algorithm to effectively design the long short-term memory (LSTM) neural network to build the non-intrusive reduced order model of the sea-surface temperature field.},

Speciﬁcally, the aim is to exploit the beneﬁts of CapsNet over convolution neural network (CNN) − retaining pose and position information related to an entity to name a few. The performance of proposed approach is illustrated by solving an elliptic stochastic partial differential equation (SPDE), which also governs systems in mechanics such as steady heat conduction, ground water ﬂow or other diffusion processes, based uncertainty quantiﬁcation problem with an input dimensionality of 1024. However, the problem deﬁnition does not the restrict the random diffusion ﬁeld to a particular covariance structure, and the more strenuous task of response prediction for an arbitrary diffusion ﬁeld is solved. The obtained results from performance evaluation indicate that the proposed approach is accurate, efﬁcient, and robust.},

	abstract = {Surrogate neural network-based models have been lately trained and used in a variety of science and engineering applications where the number of evaluations of a target function is limited by execution time. In cell phone camera systems, various errors, such as interferences at the lens-barrel and lens-lens interfaces and axial, radial, and tilt misalignments, accumulate and alter profile of the lenses in a stochastic manner which ultimately changes optical focusing properties. Nonlinear finite element analysis of the stochastic mechanical behavior of lenses due to the interference fits is used on high-performance computing (HPC) to generate sufficient training and testing data for subsequent deep learning. Once properly trained and validated, the surrogate neural network model enabled accurate and almost instant evaluations of millions of function evaluations providing the final lens profiles. This computational model, enhanced by artificial intelligence, enabled us to efficiently perform Monte-Carlo analysis for sensitivity and uncertainty quantification of the final lens profile to various interferences. It can be further coupled with an optical analysis to perform ray tracing and analyze the focal properties of the lens module. Moreover, it can provide a valuable tool for optimizing tolerance design and intelligent components matching for many similar press-fit assembly processes.},

We call such a surface a rigidly rotating ZAMO surface. This definition allows a natural generalization to the surfaces inside the black hole, where ZAMO's trajectories formally become spacelike. A general property of such a surface is that there exist linear combinations of the Killing vectors with constant coefficients which make them orthogonal on it. In this paper we discuss properties of the rigidly rotating ZAMO surfaces both outside and inside the black hole and relevance of these objects to a couple of interesting physical problems.},

It is shown that these equations can be put in numerical difference form so that angular momentum is locally conserved. Numerical simulations are given for two simple cases, the evolution of a simple twist in a steady Keplerian accretion disc, and the effect of precession about an axis which is not aligned with the disc on the inner regions of the disc (the Bardeen-Petterson effect). It is emphasized that the methods presented here can be applied to more general rotation laws, and precession rates - for example, warped gaseous discs in galactic potentials.},

	abstract = {The future LISA detector will constitute the prime instrument for high-precision gravitational wave observations. Among other goals, LISA is expected to materialize a 'spacetime-mapping' program that is to provide information for the properties of spacetime in the vicinity of supermassive black holes which reside in the majority of galactic nuclei. Such black holes can capture stellar-mass compact objects, which afterwards slowly inspiral under the emission of gravitational radiation. The small body's orbital motion and the associated waveform observed at infinity carry information about the spacetime metric of the massive black hole, and in principle it is possible to extract this information and experimentally identify (or not!) a Kerr black hole. In this paper we lay the foundations for a practical spacetime-mapping framework. Our work is based on the assumption that the massive body is not necessarily a Kerr black hole, and that the vacuum exterior spacetime is stationary axisymmetric, described by a metric which deviates slightly from the known Kerr metric. We first provide a simple recipe for building such a 'quasi-Kerr' metric by adding to the Kerr metric the leading order deviation which appears in the value of the spacetime's quadrupole moment. We then study geodesic motion of a test body in this metric, mainly focusing on equatorial orbits, but also providing equations describing generic orbits formulated by means of canonical perturbation theory techniques. We proceed by computing approximate 'kludge' gravitational waveforms which we compare with their Kerr counterparts. We find that a modest deviation from the Kerr metric is sufficient for producing a significant mismatch between the waveforms, provided we fix the orbital parameters. This result suggests that an attempt to use Kerr waveform templates for studying extreme mass ratio inspirals around a non-Kerr object might result in serious loss of signal-to-noise ratio and total number of detected events. The waveform comparisons also unveil a 'confusion' problem, that is the possibility of matching a true non-Kerr waveform with a Kerr template of different orbital parameters.},

	abstract = {Observations of the black hole shadow of supermassive black holes, such as Sagittarius A* at the center of our Milky Way galaxy, allow us to study the properties of black holes and the nature of strong-field gravity. According to the Kerr hypothesis, isolated, stationary, and axisymmetric astrophysical black holes are described by the Kerr metric. The Kerr hypothesis holds in general relativity and in some modified gravity theories, but there are others in which it is violated. In principle, black hole shadow observations can be used to determine if the Kerr metric is the correct description for black holes, and in turn, they could be used to place constraints on modified gravity theories that do not admit the Kerr solution. We here investigate whether black hole shadow observations can constrain deviations from general relativity, focusing on two well-motivated modified quadratic gravity theories: Einstein-dilaton-Gauss-Bonnet gravity and dynamical Chern-Simons gravity. We show that current constraints on Einstein-dilaton-Gauss-Bonnet gravity are stronger than any that could be placed with black hole shadow observations of supermassive black holes. We also show that the same holds for dynamical Chern-Simons gravity through a systematic bias and a likelihood analysis when considering slowly-rotating supermassive black holes. However, observations of more rapidly-rotating black holes, with dimensionless spins , could be used to better constrain dynamical Chern-Simons gravity.},

	abstract = {Cosmic microwave background radiation (CMB) is critical to the understanding of the early universe and precise estimation of cosmological constants. Due to the contamination of thermal dust noise in the galaxy, the CMB map that is an image on the two-dimensional sphere has missing observations, mainly concentrated on the equatorial region. The noise of the CMB map has a signiﬁcant impact on the estimation precision for cosmological parameters. Inpainting the CMB map can effectively reduce the uncertainty of parametric estimation. In this paper, we propose a deep learning-based variational autoencoder — CosmoVAE, to restoring the missing observations of the CMB map. The input and output of CosmoVAE are square images. To generate training, validation, and test data sets, we segment the full-sky CMB map into many small images by Cartesian projection. CosmoVAE assigns physical quantities to the parameters of the VAE network by using the angular power spectrum of the Gaussian random ﬁeld as latent variables. CosmoVAE adopts a new loss function to improve the learning performance of the model, which consists of 1 reconstruction loss, Kullback-Leibler divergence between the posterior distribution of encoder network and the prior distribution of latent variables, perceptual loss, and total-variation regularizer. The proposed model achieves state of the art performance for Planck Commander 2018 CMB map inpainting.},

Besides this so-called Hubble–Lemaître tension, we also find considerable evidence in diverse cosmological observables that indicate violation of the cosmological principle. In this paper, we suggest that both these discrepancies are related and can be explained by invoking superhorizon perturbations in the universe. We implement this by considering a single superhorizon mode and showing that it leads to both a dipole in large-scale structures and a shift in the Hubble–Lemaître parameter. Furthermore, the shift is found to be independent of redshift up to a certain distance. This is nicely consistent with the data.},

Recent observations of Sagittarius A* with the Event Horizon Telescope have revealed horizon-scale structure. Accordingly, the detection and measurement of the back hole “shadow” is expected to enable the existence of astrophysical black holes to be veriﬁed directly. Although the theoretical description of the shadow is straightforward, its observational appearance is largely determined by the properties of the surrounding accretion ﬂow, which is highly turbulent. We introduce a new polarised generalrelativistic radiative transfer code, BHOSS, which accurately solves the equations of polarised radiative transfer in arbitrary strong-gravity environments, providing physically-realistic images of astrophysical black holes on event horizon-scales, as well as also providing insight into the fundamental properties and nature of the surrounding accretion ﬂow environment.},

Short reverberation lags are expected between the primary hard X-ray continuum and the reprocessed disk emission. These lags depend on light-travel distances, thus offering the opportunity to map the geometry of the innermost accretion flow. X-ray reverberation lags have been observed in several BH accreting systems. In radio-quiet active galactic nuclei (AGN), these lags scale with BH mass and point to a reprocessing region located close to the comptonizing X-ray corona. On the other hand, reverberation lags detected in the hard state of some BH X-ray binaries (BHXRB) suggest a different accretion flow geometry than in AGN, showing evidence of evolution as a function of luminosity.},

A promising avenue for testing the hypothesis that astrophysical black holes are described by the Kerr solution to Einstein’s equations is to compare the size and shape of the shadow a black hole casts on the surrounding emission to the predictions of the Kerr metric. We develop here an efﬁcient parametric framework to perform this test. We carry out ray-tracing simulations for several parameterized non-Kerr metrics to create a large data set of non-Kerr shadows that probe the allowed parameter space for the free parameters of each metric. We then perform principal components analysis (PCA) on this set of shadows and show that only a small number of components are needed to accurately reconstruct all shadows within the set. We further show that the amplitude of the PCA components are smoothly related to the free parameters in the metrics and, therefore, that these PCA components can be ﬁt to EHT observations in order to place constraints on the free parameters of these metrics that will help quantify any potential deviations from the Kerr solution.},

	abstract = {Thermal-dominated X-ray spectra of neutron stars in quiescent, transient X-ray binaries and neutron stars that undergo thermonuclear bursts are sensitive to mass and radius. The mass–radius relation of neutron stars depends on the equation of state (EoS) that governs their interior. Constraining this relation accurately is therefore of fundamental importance to understand the nature of dense matter. In this context, we introduce a pipeline to calculate realistic model spectra of rotating neutron stars with hydrogen and helium atmospheres. An arbitrarily fast-rotating neutron star with a given EoS generates the spacetime in which the atmosphere emits radiation. We use the LORENE/NROTSTAR code to compute the spacetime numerically and the ATM24 code to solve the radiative transfer equations self-consistently. Emerging speciﬁc intensity spectra are then ray-traced through the neutron star’s spacetime from the atmosphere to a distant observer with the GYOTO code. Here, we present and test our fully relativistic numerical pipeline. To discuss and illustrate the importance of realistic atmosphere models, we compare our model spectra to simpler models like the commonly used isotropic color-corrected blackbody emission. We highlight the importance of considering realistic model-atmosphere spectra together with relativistic ray-tracing to obtain accurate predictions. We also insist upon the crucial impact of the star’s rotation on the observables. Finally, we close a controversy that has been ongoing in the literature in the recent years, regarding the validity of the ATM24 code.},

ARCMANCER supports Riemannian and semi-Riemannian spaces of any dimension and metric, and has novel features such as support for multiple simultaneous coordinate charts, embedded geometric shapes, local coordinate systems, and automatic parallel propagation. The ARCMANCER interface is extensively documented and user friendly. While these capabilities make the library well suited for a large variety of problems in numerical geometry, the main focus of this paper is in general relativistic polarized radiative transfer. The accuracy of the code is demonstrated in several code tests and in a comparison with GRTRANS, an existing ray-tracing code. We then use the library in several scenarios as a way to showcase the wide applicability of the code. We study a thin variable-geometry accretion disk model and find that polarization carries information of the inner disk opening angle. Next, we study rotating neutron stars and determine that to obtain polarized light curves at better than a ∼ 1 \% level of accuracy, the rotation needs to be taken into account both in the spacetime metric and in the shape of the star. Finally, we investigate the observational signatures of an accreting black hole lensed by an orbiting black hole. We find that these systems exhibit a characteristic asymmetric twin-peak profile both in flux and polarization properties.},

In particular, the extreme case of a black hole where the curvature becomes so strong that even light cannot escape, benefits from an interactive visualization where students can investigate the distortion effects by moving objects around. However, the most commonly used technique of four-dimensional general-relativistic ray tracing is still too slow for interactive frame rates. Therefore, we propose an efficient and adaptive polygon rendering method that takes light deflection and light travel time into account. An additional advantage of this method is that it provides a natural demonstration of how multiple images occur and how light travel time affects them. Finally, we present our method using three example scenes: a triangle passing behind a black hole, a sphere orbiting a black hole and an accretion disk with different inclination angles.},

In total, we identify at least 12 qualitatively different patterns of spectral variability, involving several different mechanisms, including five sources which show evidence of variable relativistic reflection (MCG–6-30-15, NGC 4051, 1H 0707−495, NGC 3516 and Mrk 766) and three which show evidence of varying partial covering neutral absorption (NGC 4395, NGC 1365 and NGC 4151). In over half of the sources studied, the variability is dominated by changes in a power-law continuum, both in terms of changes in flux and power-law index, which could be produced by propagating fluctuations within the corona. Simulations are used to find unique predictions for different physical models, and we then attempt to qualitatively match the results from the simulations to the behaviour observed in the real data. We are able to explain a large proportion of the variability in these sources using simple models of spectral variability, but more complex models may be needed for the remainder. We have begun the process of building up a library of different principal components, so that spectral variability in AGN can quickly be matched to physical processes. We show that PCA can be an extremely powerful tool for distinguishing different patterns of variability in AGN, and that it can be used effectively on the large amounts of high-quality archival data available from the current generation of X-ray telescopes. We will make our PCA code available upon request to the lead author.},

We find the correct known equations, including force laws and Hamiltonians, can be extracted from the neural network. We then apply our method to a non-trivial cosmology example-a detailed dark matter simulation-and discover a new analytic formula which can predict the concentration of dark matter from the mass distribution of nearby cosmic structures. The symbolic expressions extracted from the GNN using our technique also generalized to out-of-distribution data better than the GNN itself. Our approach offers alternative directions for interpreting neural networks and discovering novel physical principles from the representations they learn.},

The aim of this textbook is to introduce machine learning, and the algorithmic paradigms it offers, in a principled way. The book provides an extensive theoretical account of the fundamental ideas underlying machine learning and the mathematical derivations that transform these principles into practical algorithms. Following a presentation of the basics of the field, the book covers a wide array of central topics that have not been addressed by previous textbooks. These include a discussion of the computational complexity of learning and the concepts of convexity and stability; important algorithmic paradigms including stochastic gradient descent, neural networks, and structured output learning; and emerging theoretical concepts such as the PAC-Bayes approach and compression-based bounds. Designed for an advanced undergraduate or beginning graduate course, the text makes the fundamentals and algorithms of machine learning accessible to students and non-expert readers in statistics, computer science, mathematics, and engineering"},

of the reprocessing of corona photons by the underlying accretion disk,
has allowed us to probe the properties of the innermost regions of the
accretion flow and the central black hole. This process is modeled via
raytracing in the Kerr metric, with the disk thickness almost
ubiquitously assumed to be negligible (“razor thin”) and the
corona commonly approximated as a point source located along the polar
axis (a lamppost). In this work, we use the new raytracing suite,
Fenrir, to explore the effect that accretion disk geometry has on
reverberation signatures, assuming a lamppost configuration but allowing
for a finite disk scale height. We characterize the signatures of finite
disk thickness in the reverberation transfer function and calculate how
they might manifest in observed lag-frequency spectra. We also show that
a disk-hugging corona (approximated by off-axis point-like flares)
exhibits characteristics that are qualitatively different from
observation, thus providing further evidence for a flaring corona that
is separated from the underlying disk material.},

The proposed method takes advantage of recent developments in differentiable programming to propagate gradient information through ordinary differential equation solvers and perform Bayesian inference with respect to unknown model parameters using Hamiltonian Monte Carlo. This allows us to efﬁciently infer posterior distributions over plausible models with quantiﬁed uncertainty, while the use of sparsitypromoting priors enables the discovery of interpretable and parsimonious representations for the underlying latent dynamics. A series of numerical studies is presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methods including nonlinear oscillators, predator-prey systems, chaotic dynamics and systems biology.

Such structures could result in a false signal when the background is estimated from data using sideband methods. A variety of techniques have been developed to construct classifiers which are independent from the resonant feature (often a mass). Such strategies are sufficient to avoid localized structures, but are not necessary. We develop a new set of tools using a novel moment loss function (Moment Decomposition or MoDe) which relax the assumption of independence without creating structures in the background. By allowing classifiers to be more flexible, we enhance the sensitivity to new physics without compromising the fidelity of the background estimation.},

We study the UNKNOT problem of determining whether or not a given knot is the unknot. After describing an algorithm to randomly generate \$N\$-crossing braids and their knot closures and discussing the induced prior on the distribution of knots, we apply binary classification to the UNKNOT decision problem. We find that the Reformer and shared-QK Transformer network architectures outperform fully-connected networks, though all perform well. Perhaps surprisingly, we find that accuracy increases with the length of the braid word, and that the networks learn a direct correlation between the confidence of their predictions and the degree of the Jones polynomial. Finally, we utilize reinforcement learning (RL) to find sequences of Markov moves and braid relations that simplify knots and can identify unknots by explicitly giving the sequence of unknotting actions. Trust region policy optimization (TRPO) performs consistently well for a wide range of crossing numbers and thoroughly outperformed other RL algorithms and random walkers. Studying these actions, we find that braid relations are more useful in simplifying to the unknot than one of the Markov moves.},

We present a new strategy dubbed Quasi Anomalous Knowledge (QUAK), whereby we introduce alternative signal priors that capture some of the salient features of new physics signatures, allowing for the recovery of sensitivity even when the alternative signal is incorrect. This approach can be applied to a broad range of physics models and neural network architectures.

	abstract = {One of the key tasks of any particle collider is measurement. In practice, this is often done by fitting data to a simulation, which depends on many parameters. Sometimes, when the effects of varying different parameters are highly correlated, a large ensemble of data may be needed to resolve parameter-space degeneracies. An important example is measuring the top-quark mass, where other physical and unphysical parameters in the simulation must be marginalized over when fitting the top-quark mass parameter. We compare three different methodologies for top-quark mass measurement: a classical histogram fitting procedure, similar to one commonly used in experiment optionally augmented with soft-drop jet grooming; a machine-learning method called DCTR; and a linear regression approach, either using a least-squares fit or with a dense linearly-activated neural network. Despite the fact that individual events are totally uncorrelated, we find that the linear regression methods work most effectively when we input an ensemble of events sorted by mass, rather than training them on individual events. Although all methods provide robust extraction of the top-quark mass parameter, the linear network does marginally best and is remarkably simple. For the top study, we conclude that the Monte-Carlo-based uncertainty on current extractions of the top-quark mass from LHC data can be reduced significantly (by perhaps a factor of 2) using networks trained on sorted event ensembles. More generally, machine learning from ensembles for parameter estimation has broad potential for collider physics measurements.},

In particular, the application of these methods to the full signal parameter space available to the gravitational-wave detectors, and/or real-time parameter estimation is computationally prohibitive. On the other hand, rapid detection and inference are critical for prompt follow-up of the electromagnetic and astro-particle counterparts accompanying important transients, such as binary neutron-star and black-hole neutron-star mergers. Training deep neural networks to identify specific signals and learn a computationally efficient representation of the mapping between gravitational-wave signals and their parameters allows both detection and inference to be done quickly and reliably, with high sensitivity and accuracy. In this work we apply a deep-learning approach to rapidly identify and characterize transient gravitational-wave signals from binary neutron-star mergers in real LIGO data. We show for the first time that artificial neural networks can promptly detect and characterize binary neutron star gravitational-wave signals in real LIGO data, and distinguish them from noise and signals from coalescing black-hole binaries. We illustrate this key result by demonstrating that our deep-learning framework classifies correctly all gravitational-wave events from the Gravitational-Wave Transient Catalog, GWTC-1 [Phys. Rev. X 9 (2019), 031040]. These results emphasize the importance of using realistic gravitational-wave detector data in machine learning approaches, and represent a step towards achieving real-time detection and inference of gravitational waves.},

To evaluate the efficacy of these proposals, we study the connection between single-event classifiers and multi-event classifiers under the assumption that collider events are independent and identically distributed (IID). We show how one can build optimal multi-event classifiers from single-event classifiers, and we also show how to construct multi-event classifiers such that they produce optimal single-event classifiers. This is illustrated for a Gaussian example as well as for classification tasks relevant for searches and measurements at the Large Hadron Collider. We extend our discussion to regression tasks by showing how they can be phrased in terms of parametrized classifiers. Empirically, we find that training a single-event (per-instance) classifier is more effective than training a multi-event (per-ensemble) classifier, as least for the cases we studied, and we relate this fact to properties of the loss function gradient in the two cases. While we did not identify a clear benefit from using multi-event classifiers in the collider context, we speculate on the potential value of these methods in cases involving only approximate independence, as relevant for jet substructure studies.},

In order to develop and benchmark new anomaly detection methods within this framework, it is essential to have standard datasets. To this end, we have created the LHC Olympics 2020, a community challenge accompanied by a set of simulated collider events. Participants in these Olympics have developed their methods using an R\&D dataset and then tested them on black boxes: datasets with an unknown anomaly (or not). This paper will review the LHC Olympics 2020 challenge, including an overview of the competition, a description of methods deployed in the competition, lessons learned from the experience, and implications for data analyses with future datasets as well as future colliders.},

	abstract = {Recent approaches in the theoretical analysis of model-based deep learning architectures have studied the convergence of gradient descent in shallow ReLU networks that arise from generative models whose hidden layers are sparse. Motivated by the success of architectures that impose structured forms of sparsity, we introduce and study a group-sparse autoencoder that accounts for a variety of generative models, and utilizes a group-sparse ReLU activation function to force the non-zero units at a given layer to occur in blocks. For clustering models, inputs that result in the same group of active units belong to the same cluster. We proceed to analyze the gradient dynamics of a shallow instance of the proposed autoencoder, trained with data adhering to a group-sparse generative model. In this setting, we theoretically prove the convergence of the network parameters to a neighborhood of the generating matrix. We validate our model through numerical analysis and highlight the superior performance of networks with a group-sparse ReLU compared to networks that utilize traditional ReLUs, both in sparse coding and in parameter recovery tasks. We also provide real data experiments to corroborate the simulated results, and emphasize the clustering capabilities of structured sparsity models.},

In the fixed design setting, we show that the error is governed by the global complexity of the entire class. In contrast, in random design, ERM may only adapt to simpler models if the local neighborhoods around the regression function are nearly as complex as the class itself, a somewhat counter-intuitive conclusion. We provide sharp lower bounds for performance of ERM for both Donsker and non-Donsker classes.

	abstract = {Autoencoders have been proposed as a powerful tool for model-independent anomaly detection in high-energy physics. The operating principle is that events which do not belong to the space of training data will be reconstructed poorly, thus flagging them as anomalies. We point out that in a variety of examples of interest, the connection between large reconstruction error and anomalies is not so clear. In particular, for data sets with nontrivial topology, there will always be points that erroneously seem anomalous due to global issues. Conversely, neural networks typically have an inductive bias or prior to locally interpolate such that undersampled or rare events may be reconstructed with small error, despite actually being the desired anomalies. Taken together, these facts are in tension with the simple picture of the autoencoder as an anomaly detector. Using a series of illustrative low-dimensional examples, we show explicitly how the intrinsic and extrinsic topology of the dataset affects the behavior of an autoencoder and how this topology is manifested in the latent space representation during training. We ground this analysis in the discussion of a mock "bump hunt" in which the autoencoder fails to identify an anomalous "signal" for reasons tied to the intrinsic topology of \$n\$-particle phase space.},

SN{\textbackslash},2019stc exhibits a broad double-peaked light curve, with the first peak having an absolute magnitude of \$M\_r=-20.0\$ mag, and the second peak, about 80 rest-frame days later, \$M\_r=-19.2\$ mag. The total radiated energy is large, \$E\_\{{\textbackslash}rm rad\}{\textbackslash}approx 2.5{\textbackslash}times 10{\textasciicircum}\{50\}\$ erg. Despite its large luminosity, approaching those of Type I superluminous supernovae (SLSNe), SN{\textbackslash},2019stc exhibits a typical SN Ic spectrum, bridging the gap between SLSNe and SNe Ic. The spectra indicate the presence of Fe-peak elements, but modeling of the first light curve peak with radioactive heating alone leads to an unusually high nickel mass fraction of \$f\_\{{\textbackslash}rm Ni\}{\textbackslash}approx 31{\textbackslash}\%\$ (\$M\_\{{\textbackslash}rm Ni\}{\textbackslash}approx 3.2\$ M\$\_{\textbackslash}odot\$). Instead, if we model the first peak with a combined magnetar spin-down and radioactive heating model we find a better match with \$M\_\{{\textbackslash}rm ej\}{\textbackslash}approx 4\$ M\$\_{\textbackslash}odot\$, a magnetar spin period of \$P\_\{{\textbackslash}rm spin\}{\textbackslash}approx 7.2\$ ms and magnetic field of \$B{\textbackslash}approx 10{\textasciicircum}\{14\}\$ G, and \$f\_\{{\textbackslash}rm Ni\}{\textbackslash}lesssim 0.2\$ (consistent with SNe Ic). The prominent second peak cannot be naturally accommodated with radioactive heating or magnetar spin-down, but instead can be explained as circumstellar interaction with \${\textbackslash}approx 0.7\$ \$M\_{\textbackslash}odot\$ of hydrogen-free material located \${\textbackslash}approx 400\$ AU from the progenitor. Including the remnant mass leads to a CO core mass prior to explosion of \${\textbackslash}approx 6.5\$ M\$\_{\textbackslash}odot\$. The host galaxy has a metallicity of \${\textbackslash}approx 0.26\$ Z\$\_{\textbackslash}odot\$, low for SNe Ic but consistent with SLSNe.

	abstract = {The remarkable practical success of deep learning has revealed some major surprises from a theoretical perspective. In particular, simple gradient methods easily find near-optimal solutions to non-convex optimization problems, and despite giving a near-perfect fit to training data without any explicit effort to control model complexity, these methods exhibit excellent predictive accuracy. We conjecture that specific principles underlie these phenomena: that overparametrization allows gradient methods to find interpolating solutions, that these methods implicitly impose regularization, and that overparametrization leads to benign overfitting. We survey recent theoretical progress that provides examples illustrating these principles in simpler settings. We first review classical uniform convergence results and why they fall short of explaining aspects of the behavior of deep learning methods. We give examples of implicit regularization in simple settings, where gradient methods lead to minimal norm functions that perfectly fit the training data. Then we review prediction methods that exhibit benign overfitting, focusing on regression problems with quadratic loss. For these methods, we can decompose the prediction rule into a simple component that is useful for prediction and a spiky component that is useful for overfitting but, in a favorable setting, does not harm prediction accuracy. We focus specifically on the linear regime for neural networks, where the network can be approximated by a linear model. In this regime, we demonstrate the success of gradient flow, and we consider benign overfitting with two-layer networks, giving an exact asymptotic analysis that precisely demonstrates the impact of overparametrization. We conclude by highlighting the key challenges that arise in extending these insights to realistic deep learning settings.},

We utilize a novel neural network architecture that, after being trained on a subset of data with complete phase-space information, takes in a star's 5D astrometry (angular coordinates, proper motions, and parallax) and outputs a predicted line-of-sight velocity with an associated uncertainty. Working with a mock Gaia catalog, we show that the network can successfully recover the distributions and correlations of each velocity component for stars that fall within {\textasciitilde}5 kpc of the Sun. We also demonstrate that the network can accurately reconstruct the velocity distribution of a kinematic substructure in the stellar halo that is spatially uniform, even when it comprises a small fraction of the total star count.},

	abstract = {The identification and description of point sources is one of the oldest problems in astronomy; yet, even today the correct statistical treatment for point sources remains as one of the field's hardest problems. For dim or crowded sources, likelihood based inference methods are required to estimate the uncertainty on the characteristics of the source population. In this work, a new parametric likelihood is constructed for this problem using Compound Poisson Generator (CPG) functionals which incorporate instrumental effects from first principles. We demonstrate that the CPG approach exhibits a number advantages over Non-Poissonian Template Fitting (NPTF) - an existing parametric likelihood method - in a series of test scenarios in the context of X-ray astronomy. These demonstrations show that the effect of the point-spread function, effective area, and choice of point-source spatial distribution cannot, in general, be factorised as they are in the NPTF construction, while the new CPG construction is validated in these scenarios. Separately, an examination of the diffuse-flux emission limit is used to show that most simple choices of priors on the standard parameterisation of the population model can result in unexpected biases: when a model comprising both a point-source population and diffuse component is applied to this limit, nearly all observed flux will be assigned to either the population or to the diffuse component. A new parametrisation is presented for these priors which is demonstrated to properly estimate the uncertainties in this limit. In this choice of priors, the CPG correctly identifies that the fraction of flux assigned to the population model cannot be constrained by the data.},

	abstract = {Bayesian optimization (BO) is a popular paradigm for global optimization of expensive black-box functions, but there are many domains where the function is not completely black-box. The data may have some known structure, e.g. symmetries, and the data generation process can yield useful intermediate or auxiliary information in addition to the value of the optimization objective. However, surrogate models traditionally employed in BO, such as Gaussian Processes (GPs), scale poorly with dataset size and struggle to incorporate known structure or auxiliary information. Instead, we propose performing BO on complex, structured problems by using Bayesian Neural Networks (BNNs), a class of scalable surrogate models that have the representation power and flexibility to handle structured data and exploit auxiliary information. We demonstrate BO on a number of realistic problems in physics and chemistry, including topology optimization of photonic crystal materials using convolutional neural networks, and chemical property optimization of molecules using graph neural networks. On these complex tasks, we show that BNNs often outperform GPs as surrogate models for BO in terms of both sampling efficiency and computational cost.},

	abstract = {Despite advances in the programmable logic capabilities of modern trigger systems, a significant bottleneck remains in the amount of data to be transported from the detector to off-detector logic where trigger decisions are made. We demonstrate that a neural network autoencoder model can be implemented in a radiation tolerant ASIC to perform lossy data compression alleviating the data transmission problem while preserving critical information of the detector energy profile. For our application, we consider the high-granularity calorimeter from the CMS experiment at the CERN Large Hadron Collider. The advantage of the machine learning approach is in the flexibility and configurability of the algorithm. By changing the neural network weights, a unique data compression algorithm can be deployed for each sensor in different detector regions, and changing detector or collider conditions. To meet area, performance, and power constraints, we perform a quantization-aware training to create an optimized neural network hardware implementation. The design is achieved through the use of high-level synthesis tools and the hls4ml framework, and was processed through synthesis and physical layout flows based on a LP CMOS 65 nm technology node. The flow anticipates 200 Mrad of ionizing radiation to select gates, and reports a total area of 3.6 mm{\textasciicircum}2 and consumes 95 mW of power. The simulated energy consumption per inference is 2.4 nJ. This is the first radiation tolerant on-detector ASIC implementation of a neural network that has been designed for particle physics applications.},

We propose a simulation-based maximum likelihood deconvolution approach in this setting called OmniFold. Deep learning enables this approach to be naturally unbinned and (variable-, and) high-dimensional. In contrast to model parameter estimation, the goal of deconvolution is to remove detector distortions in order to enable a variety of down-stream inference tasks. Our approach is the deep learning generalization of the common Richardson-Lucy approach that is also called Iterative Bayesian Unfolding in particle physics. We show how OmniFold can not only remove detector distortions, but it can also account for noise processes and acceptance effects.},

Specifically, given a trajectory governed by unknown forces, our Neural New-Physics Detector (NNPhD) aims to detect new physics by decomposing the force field into conservative and non-conservative components, which are represented by a Lagrangian Neural Network (LNN) and a universal approximator network (UAN), respectively, trained to minimize the force recovery error plus a constant \${\textbackslash}lambda\$ times the magnitude of the predicted non-conservative force. We show that a phase transition occurs at \${\textbackslash}lambda\$=1, universally for arbitrary forces. We demonstrate that NNPhD successfully discovers new physics in toy numerical experiments, rediscovering friction (1493) from a damped double pendulum, Neptune from Uranus' orbit (1846) and gravitational waves (2017) from an inspiraling orbit. We also show how NNPhD coupled with an integrator outperforms previous methods for predicting the future of a damped double pendulum.},

Input and output symmetries of neural network densities are determined, which recover known Gaussian process results in the infinite width limit. The mechanism may also be utilized to determine symmetries during training, when parameters are correlated, as well as symmetries of the Neural Tangent Kernel. We demonstrate that the amount of symmetry in the initialization density affects the accuracy of networks trained on Fashion-MNIST, and that symmetry breaking helps only when it is in the direction of ground truth.},

	abstract = {Inferring representations of 3D scenes from 2D observations is a fundamental problem of computer graphics, computer vision, and artificial intelligence. Emerging 3D-structured neural scene representations are a promising approach to 3D scene understanding. In this work, we propose a novel neural scene representation, Light Field Networks or LFNs, which represent both geometry and appearance of the underlying 3D scene in a 360-degree, four-dimensional light field parameterized via a neural implicit representation. Rendering a ray from an LFN requires only a single network evaluation, as opposed to hundreds of evaluations per ray for ray-marching or volumetric based renderers in 3D-structured neural scene representations. In the setting of simple scenes, we leverage meta-learning to learn a prior over LFNs that enables multi-view consistent light field reconstruction from as little as a single image observation. This results in dramatic reductions in time and memory complexity, and enables real-time rendering. The cost of storing a 360-degree light field via an LFN is two orders of magnitude lower than conventional methods such as the Lumigraph. Utilizing the analytical differentiability of neural implicit representations and a novel parameterization of light space, we further demonstrate the extraction of sparse depth maps from LFNs.},

Electrons, ubiquitous elementary particles of nonzero charge, spin, and mass, have commonly been perceived as paradigmatic local quantum information carriers. Despite superior controllability and configurability, their practical performance as qubits via either motional or spin states depends critically on their material environment. Here we report our experimental realization of a new qubit platform based upon isolated single electrons trapped on an ultraclean solid neon surface in vacuum. By integrating an electron trap in a circuit quantum electrodynamics architecture, we achieve strong coupling between the motional states of a single electron and a single microwave photon in an on-chip superconducting resonator. Qubit gate operations and dispersive readout are implemented to measure the energy relaxation time \$T\_1\$ of 15\${\textbackslash}mu\$s and phase coherence time \$T\_2\$ over 200ns. These results indicate that the electron-on-solid-neon qubit already performs near the state of the art as a charge qubit.},

	abstract = {This book develops an effective theory approach to understanding deep neural networks of practical relevance. Beginning from a first-principles component-level picture of networks, we explain how to determine an accurate description of the output of trained networks by solving layer-to-layer iteration equations and nonlinear learning dynamics. A main result is that the predictions of networks are described by nearly-Gaussian distributions, with the depth-to-width aspect ratio of the network controlling the deviations from the infinite-width Gaussian description. We explain how these effectively-deep networks learn nontrivial representations from training and more broadly analyze the mechanism of representation learning for nonlinear models. From a nearly-kernel-methods perspective, we find that the dependence of such models' predictions on the underlying learning algorithm can be expressed in a simple and universal way. To obtain these results, we develop the notion of representation group flow (RG flow) to characterize the propagation of signals through the network. By tuning networks to criticality, we give a practical solution to the exploding and vanishing gradient problem. We further explain how RG flow leads to near-universal behavior and lets us categorize networks built from different activation functions into universality classes. Altogether, we show that the depth-to-width ratio governs the effective model complexity of the ensemble of trained networks. By using information-theoretic techniques, we estimate the optimal aspect ratio at which we expect the network to be practically most useful and show how residual connections can be used to push this scale to arbitrary depths. With these tools, we can learn in detail about the inductive bias of architectures, hyperparameters, and optimizers.},

Empirical evaluation shows that TIA leads to significant performance gains over state-of-the-art methods on many visual control tasks where natural and unconstrained visual distractions pose a formidable challenge.},

	abstract = {In a recent work arXiv:2008.08601, Halverson, Maiti and Stoner proposed a description of neural networks in terms of a Wilsonian effective field theory. The infinite-width limit is mapped to a free field theory, while finite \$N\$ corrections are taken into account by interactions (non-Gaussian terms in the action). In this paper, we study two related aspects of this correspondence. First, we comment on the concepts of locality and power-counting in this context. Indeed, these usual space-time notions may not hold for neural networks (since inputs can be arbitrary), however, the renormalization group provides natural notions of locality and scaling. Moreover, we comment on several subtleties, for example, that data components may not have a permutation symmetry: in that case, we argue that random tensor field theories could provide a natural generalization. Second, we improve the perturbative Wilsonian renormalization from arXiv:2008.08601 by providing an analysis in terms of the nonperturbative renormalization group using the Wetterich-Morris equation. An important difference with usual nonperturbative RG analysis is that only the effective (IR) 2-point function is known, which requires setting the problem with care. Our aim is to provide a useful formalism to investigate neural networks behavior beyond the large-width limit (i.e.{\textasciitilde}far from Gaussian limit) in a nonperturbative fashion. A major result of our analysis is that changing the standard deviation of the neural network weight distribution can be interpreted as a renormalization flow in the space of networks. We focus on translations invariant kernels and provide preliminary numerical results.},

	abstract = {Optimal extraction of the non-Gaussian information encoded in the Large-Scale Structure (LSS) of the universe lies at the forefront of modern precision cosmology. We propose achieving this task through the use of the Wavelet Scattering Transform (WST), which subjects an input field to a layer of non-linear transformations that are sensitive to non-Gaussianity in spatial density distributions through a generated set of WST coefficients. In order to assess its applicability in the context of LSS surveys, we apply the WST on the 3D overdensity field obtained by the Quijote simulations, out of which we extract the Fisher information in 6 cosmological parameters. It is subsequently found to deliver a large improvement in the marginalized errors on all parameters, ranging between \$1.2-4{\textbackslash}times\$ tighter than the corresponding ones obtained from the regular 3D cold dark matter + baryon power spectrum, as well as a \$50 {\textbackslash}\%\$ improvement over the neutrino mass constraint given by the marked power spectrum. Through this first application on 3D cosmological fields, we demonstrate the great promise held by this novel statistic and set the stage for its future application to actual galaxy observations.},

	abstract = {The field of transient astronomy has seen a revolution with the first gravitational-wave detections and the arrival of multi-messenger observations they enabled. Transformed by the first detection of binary black hole and binary neutron star mergers, computational demands in gravitational-wave astronomy are expected to grow by at least a factor of two over the next five years as the global network of kilometer-scale interferometers are brought to design sensitivity. With the increase in detector sensitivity, real-time delivery of gravitational-wave alerts will become increasingly important as an enabler of multi-messenger followup. In this work, we report a novel implementation and deployment of deep learning inference for real-time gravitational-wave data denoising and astrophysical source identification. This is accomplished using a generic Inference-as-a-Service model that is capable of adapting to the future needs of gravitational-wave data analysis. Our implementation allows seamless incorporation of hardware accelerators and also enables the use of commercial or private (dedicated) as-a-service computing. Based on our results, we propose a paradigm shift in low-latency and offline computing in gravitational-wave astronomy. Such a shift can address key challenges in peak-usage, scalability and reliability, and provide a data analysis platform particularly optimized for deep learning applications. The achieved sub-millisecond scale latency will also be relevant for any machine learning-based real-time control systems that may be invoked in the operation of near-future and next generation ground-based laser interferometers, as well as the front-end collection, distribution and processing of data from such instruments.},

	abstract = {Restricted Boltzmann machines (RBMs) have proven to be a powerful tool for learning quantum wavefunction representations from qubit projective measurement data. Since the number of classical parameters needed to encode a quantum wavefunction scales rapidly with the number of qubits, the ability to learn efficient representations is of critical importance. In this paper we study magnitude-based pruning as a way to compress the wavefunction representation in an RBM, focusing on RBMs trained on data from the transverse-field Ising model in one dimension. We find that pruning can reduce the total number of RBM weights, but the threshold at which the reconstruction accuracy starts to degrade varies significantly depending on the phase of the model. In a gapped region of the phase diagram, the RBM admits pruning over half of the weights while still accurately reproducing relevant physical observables. At the quantum critical point however, even a small amount of pruning can lead to significant loss of accuracy in the physical properties of the reconstructed quantum state. Our results highlight the importance of tracking all relevant observables as their sensitivity varies strongly with pruning. Finally, we find that sparse RBMs are trainable and discuss how a successful sparsity pattern can be created without pruning.},

	abstract = {Anomaly detection relies on designing a score to determine whether a particular event is uncharacteristic of a given background distribution. One way to define a score is to use autoencoders, which rely on the ability to reconstruct certain types of data (background) but not others (signals). In this paper, we study some challenges associated with variational autoencoders, such as the dependence on hyperparameters and the metric used, in the context of anomalous signal (top and \$W\$) jets in a QCD background. We find that the hyperparameter choices strongly affect the network performance and that the optimal parameters for one signal are non-optimal for another. In exploring the networks, we uncover a connection between the latent space of a variational autoencoder trained using mean-squared-error and the optimal transport distances within the dataset. We then show that optimal transport distances to representative events in the background dataset can be used directly for anomaly detection, with performance comparable to the autoencoders. Whether using autoencoders or optimal transport distances for anomaly detection, we find that the choices that best represent the background are not necessarily best for signal identification. These challenges with unsupervised anomaly detection bolster the case for additional exploration of semi-supervised or alternative approaches.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/2110.06931},
	abstract = {The nature of the Fermi gamma-ray Galactic Center Excess (GCE) has remained a persistent mystery for over a decade. Although the excess is broadly compatible with emission expected due to dark matter annihilation, an explanation in terms of a population of unresolved astrophysical point sources e.g., millisecond pulsars, remains viable. The effort to uncover the origin of the GCE is hampered in particular by an incomplete understanding of diffuse emission of Galactic origin. This can lead to spurious features that make it difficult to robustly differentiate smooth emission, as expected for a dark matter origin, from more "clumpy" emission expected for a population of relatively bright, unresolved point sources. We use recent advancements in the field of simulation-based inference, in particular density estimation techniques using normalizing flows, in order to characterize the contribution of modeled components, including unresolved point source populations, to the GCE. Compared to traditional techniques based on the statistical distribution of photon counts, our machine learning-based method is able to utilize more of the information contained in a given model of the Galactic Center emission, and in particular can perform posterior parameter estimation while accounting for pixel-to-pixel spatial correlations in the gamma-ray map. This makes the method demonstrably more resilient to certain forms of model misspecification. On application to Fermi data, the method generically attributes a smaller fraction of the GCE flux to unresolved point sources when compared to traditional approaches. We nevertheless infer such a contribution to make up a non-negligible fraction of the GCE across all analysis variations considered, with at least \$38{\textasciicircum}\{+9\}\_\{-19\}{\textbackslash}\%\$ of the excess attributed to unresolved points sources in our baseline analysis.},

	abstract = {In state-of-the-art self-supervised learning (SSL) pre-training produces semantically good representations by encouraging them to be invariant under meaningful transformations prescribed from human knowledge. In fact, the property of invariance is a trivial instance of a broader class called equivariance, which can be intuitively understood as the property that representations transform according to the way the inputs transform. Here, we show that rather than using only invariance, pre-training that encourages non-trivial equivariance to some transformations, while maintaining invariance to other transformations, can be used to improve the semantic quality of representations. Specifically, we extend popular SSL methods to a more general framework which we name Equivariant Self-Supervised Learning (E-SSL). In E-SSL, a simple additional pre-training objective encourages equivariance by predicting the transformations applied to the input. We demonstrate E-SSL's effectiveness empirically on several popular computer vision benchmarks. Furthermore, we demonstrate usefulness of E-SSL for applications beyond computer vision; in particular, we show its utility on regression problems in photonics science. We will release our code.},

We reanalyze a sub-galactic structure (in lens JVAS B1938+666) that has been previously found using the gravitational imaging technique in galaxy-galaxy lensing systems. This structure has been assumed to be a satellite in the halo of the main lens galaxy. We fit the redshift of the perturber of the system as a free parameter, using the multi-plane thin-lens approximation, and find that the redshift of the perturber is \$z\_{\textbackslash}mathrm\{int\} = 1.22{\textbackslash}substack\{+0.11 {\textbackslash}{\textbackslash} -0.11\}\$ (with a main lens redshift of \$z=0.881\$).

However, noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices pose engineering challenges to realizing quantum machine learning (QML) advantages. Recently, a series of QML computational models inspired by the noise-tolerant dynamics on the brain have emerged as a means to circumvent the hardware limitations of NISQ devices. In this article, we introduce a quantum version of a recurrent neural network (RNN), a well-known model for neural circuits in the brain. Our quantum RNN (qRNN) makes use of the natural Hamiltonian dynamics of an ensemble of interacting spin-1/2 particles as a means for computation. In the limit where the Hamiltonian is diagonal, the qRNN recovers the dynamics of the classical version. Beyond this limit, we observe that the quantum dynamics of the qRNN provide it quantum computational features that can aid it in computation. To this end, we study a qRNN based on arrays of Rydberg atoms, and show that the qRNN is indeed capable of replicating the learning of several cognitive tasks such as multitasking, decision making, and long-term memory by taking advantage of several key features of this platform such as interatomic species interactions, and quantum many-body scars.},

	abstract = {What are the symmetries of a dataset? Whereas the symmetries of an individual data element can be characterized by its invariance under various transformations, the symmetries of an ensemble of data elements are ambiguous due to Jacobian factors introduced while changing coordinates. In this paper, we provide a rigorous statistical definition of the symmetries of a dataset, which involves inertial reference densities, in analogy to inertial frames in classical mechanics. We then propose SymmetryGAN as a novel and powerful approach to automatically discover symmetries using a deep learning method based on generative adversarial networks (GANs). When applied to Gaussian examples, SymmetryGAN shows excellent empirical performance, in agreement with expectations from the analytic loss landscape. SymmetryGAN is then applied to simulated dijet events from the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) to demonstrate the potential utility of this method in high energy collider physics applications. Going beyond symmetry discovery, we consider procedures to infer the underlying symmetry group from empirical data.},

	abstract = {Making the most of the rapidly increasing population of gravitational-wave detections of black hole (BH) and neutron star (NS) mergers requires comparing observations with population synthesis predictions. In this work we investigate the combined impact from the key uncertainties in population synthesis modelling of the isolated binary evolution channel: the physical processes in massive binary-star evolution and the star formation history as a function of metallicity, \$Z\$, and redshift \$z, {\textbackslash}mathcal\{S\}(Z,z)\$. Considering these uncertainties we create 560 different publicly available model realizations and calculate the rate and distribution characteristics of detectable BHBH, BHNS, and NSNS mergers. We find that our stellar evolution and \${\textbackslash}mathcal\{S\}(Z,z)\$ variations can impact the predicted intrinsic and detectable merger rates by factors \$10{\textasciicircum}2\$-\$10{\textasciicircum}4\$. We find that BHBH rates are dominantly impacted by \${\textbackslash}mathcal\{S\}(Z,z)\$ variations, NSNS rates by stellar evolution variations and BHNS rates by both. We then consider the combined impact from all uncertainties considered in this work on the detectable mass distribution shapes (chirp mass, individual masses and mass ratio). We find that the BHNS mass distributions are predominantly impacted by massive binary-star evolution changes. For BHBH and NSNS we find that both uncertainties are important. We also find that the shape of the delay time and birth metallicity distributions are typically dominated by the choice of \${\textbackslash}mathcal\{S\}(Z,z)\$ for BHBH, BHNS and NSNS. We identify several examples of robust features in the mass distributions predicted by all 560 models, such that we expect more than 95\% of BHBH detections to contain a BH \${\textbackslash}gtrsim 8{\textbackslash},{\textbackslash}rm\{M\}\_\{{\textbackslash}odot\}\$ and have mass ratios \${\textbackslash}lesssim 4\$. Our work demonstrates that it is essential to consider a wide range of allowed models to study double compact object merger rates and properties.},

The poor scaling of current quantum chemistry algorithms on classical computers imposes an effective limit of about a few dozen atoms for which we can calculate molecular electronic structure. We present a machine learning (ML) method to break through this scaling limit and make quantum chemistry calculations of very large systems possible. We show that Euclidean Neural Networks can be trained to predict the electron density with high fidelity from limited data. Learning the electron density allows us to train a machine learning model on small systems and make accurate predictions on large ones. We show that this ML electron density model can break through the quantum scaling limit and calculate the electron density of systems of thousands of atoms with quantum accuracy.},

	abstract = {Photometric pipelines struggle to estimate both the flux and flux uncertainty for stars in the presence of structured backgrounds such as filaments or clouds. However, it is exactly stars in these complex regions that are critical to understanding star formation and the structure of the interstellar medium. We develop a method, similar to Gaussian process regression, which we term local pixelwise infilling (LPI). Using a local covariance estimate, we predict the background behind each star and the uncertainty on that prediction in order to improve estimates of flux and flux uncertainty. We show the validity of our model on synthetic data and real dust fields. We further demonstrate that the method is stable even in the crowded field limit. While we focus on optical-IR photometry, this method is not restricted to those wavelengths. We apply this technique to the 34 billion detections in the second data release of the Dark Energy Camera Plane Survey (DECaPS2). In addition to removing many \${\textgreater}3{\textbackslash}sigma\$ outliers and improving uncertainty estimates by a factor of \${\textbackslash}sim 2-3\$ on nebulous fields, we also show that our method is well-behaved on uncrowded fields. The entirely post-processing nature of our implementation of LPI photometry allows it to easily improve the flux and flux uncertainty estimates of past as well as future surveys.},

	abstract = {We present a deep machine learning (ML) approach to constraining cosmological parameters with multi-wavelength observations of galaxy clusters. The ML approach has two components: an encoder that builds a compressed representation of each galaxy cluster and a flexible CNN to estimate the cosmological model from a cluster sample. It is trained and tested on simulated cluster catalogs built from the Magneticum simulations. From the simulated catalogs, the ML method estimates the amplitude of matter fluctuations, sigma\_8, at approximately the expected theoretical limit. More importantly, the deep ML approach can be interpreted. We lay out three schemes for interpreting the ML technique: a leave-one-out method for assessing cluster importance, an average saliency for evaluating feature importance, and correlations in the terse layer for understanding whether an ML technique can be safely applied to observational data. These interpretation schemes led to the discovery of a previously unknown self-calibration mode for flux- and volume-limited cluster surveys. We describe this new mode, which uses the amplitude and peak of the cluster mass PDF as anchors for mass calibration. We introduce the term "overspecialized" to describe a common pitfall in astronomical applications of machine learning in which the ML method learns simulation-specific details, and we show how a carefully constructed architecture can be used to check for this source of systematic error.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/2201.03085},
	abstract = {Black hole X-ray binaries (BHXRBs) display a wide range of variability phenomena, from long duration spectral state changes to short-term broadband variability and quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs). A particularly puzzling aspect is the production of QPOs, which -- if properly understood -- could be used as a powerful diagnostic tool of black hole accretion and evolution. In this work we analyse a high resolution three-dimensional general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic simulation of a geometrically thin accretion disk which is tilted by \$65{\textasciicircum}\{{\textbackslash}circ\}\$ with respect to the black hole spin axis. We find that the Lense-Thirring torque from the rapidly spinning 10 \$M\_{\textbackslash}odot\$ black hole causes several sub-disks to tear off within \${\textbackslash}sim 10-20\$ gravitational radii. Tearing occurs in cycles on timescales of seconds. During each tearing cycle the inner sub-disk precesses for 1-5 periods before it falls into the black hole. We find a precession frequency of \${\textbackslash}sim 3{\textbackslash}rm Hz\$, consistent with observed low-frequency QPOs. In addition, we find a high frequency QPO (HFQPO) with centroid frequency of \${\textbackslash}sim55\$Hz in the power spectra of the mass-weighted radius of the inner disk. This signal is caused by radial epicyclic oscillations of a dense ring of gas at the tearing radius, which strongly suggests a corresponding modulation of the X-ray lightcurve and may thus explain some of the observed HFQPOs.},

The entirety of the gravitational-wave strain data from the first and second observing runs have also now been made publicly available. There is considerable interest among the broad scientific community in understanding the data and methods used in the analyses. In this paper, we provide an overview of the detector noise properties and the data analysis techniques used to detect gravitational-wave signals and infer the source properties. We describe some of the checks that are performed to validate the analyses and results from the observations of gravitational-wave events. We also address concerns that have been raised about various properties of LIGO-Virgo detector noise and the correctness of our analyses as applied to the resulting data.},

	abstract = {In this article I present a simple Newtonian heuristic for deriving a weakﬁeld approximation for the spacetime geometry of a point particle. The heuristic is based on Newtonian gravity, the notion of local inertial frames [the Einstein equivalence principle], plus the use of Galilean coordinate transformations to connect the freely falling local inertial frames back to the “ﬁxed stars”. Because of the heuristic and quasi-Newtonian manner in which the spacetime geometry is obtained, we are at best justiﬁed in expecting it to be a weak-ﬁeld approximation to the true spacetime geometry. However, in the case of a spherically symmetric point mass the result is coincidentally an exact solution of the full vacuum Einstein ﬁeld equations — it is the Schwarzschild geometry in Painlev´e–Gullstrand coordinates.},

	abstract = {(Abridged) We here continue our effort to model the behaviour of matter when orbiting or accreting onto a generic black hole by developing a new numerical code employing advanced techniques geared solve the equations of in general-relativistic hydrodynamics. The new code employs a number of high-resolution shock-capturing Riemann-solvers and reconstruction algorithms, exploiting the enhanced accuracy and the reduced computational cost of AMR techniques. In addition, the code makes use of sophisticated ray-tracing libraries that, coupled with general-relativistic radiation-transfer calculations, allow us to compute accurately the electromagnetic emissions from such accretion flows. We validate the new code by presenting an extensive series of stationary accretion flows either in spherical or axial symmetry and performed either in 2D or 3D. In addition, we consider the highly nonlinear scenario of a recoiling black hole produced in the merger of a supermassive black hole binary interacting with the surrounding circumbinary disc. In this way we can present, for the first time, ray-traced images of the shocked fluid and the light-curve resulting from consistent general-relativistic radiation-transport calculations from this process. The work presented here lays the ground for the development of a generic computational infrastructure employing AMR techniques to deal accurately and self-consistently with accretion flows onto compact objects. In addition to the accurate handling of the matter, we provide a self-consistent electromagnetic emission from these scenarios by solving the associated radiative-transfer problem. While magnetic fields are presently excluded from our analysis, the tools presented here can have a number of applications to study accretion flows onto black holes or neutron stars.},

	abstract = {The horizon-scale images of black holes obtained with the Event Horizon Telescope have provided new probes of their metrics and tests of General Relativity. The images are characterized by a bright, near circular ring from the gravitationally lensed emission from the hot plasma and a deep central depression cast by the black hole. The metric tests rely on fact that the bright ring closely traces the boundary of the black hole shadow with a small displacement that has been quantiﬁed using simulations. In this paper we develop a self-consistent covariant analytic model of the accretion ﬂow that spans a broad range of plasma conditions and black-hole properties to explore the general validity of this result. We show that, for any physical model of the accretion ﬂow, the ring always encompasses the outline of the shadow and is not displaced by it by more than half the ring width. This result is a consequence of conservation laws and basic thermodynamic considerations and does not depend on the microphysics of the plasma or the details of the numerical simulations. We also present a quantitative measurement of the bias between the bright ring and the shadow radius based on the analytical models.},

	abstract = {Magnetic reconnection can power bright, rapid ﬂares originating from the inner magnetosphere of accreting black holes. We conduct extremely high-resolution (5376 × 2304 × 2304 cells) general-relativistic magnetohydrodynamics simulations, capturing plasmoid-mediated reconnection in a 3D magnetically arrested disk for the ﬁrst time. We show that an equatorial, plasmoid-unstable current sheet forms in a transient, nonaxisymmetric, low-density magnetosphere within the inner few Schwarzschild radii. Magnetic ﬂux bundles escape from the event horizon through reconnection at the universal plasmoid-mediated rate in this current sheet. The reconnection feeds on the highly magnetized plasma in the jets and heats the plasma that ends up trapped in ﬂux bundles to temperatures proportional to the jet’s magnetization. The escaped ﬂux bundles can complete a full orbit as low-density hot spots, consistent with Sgr A* observations by the GRAVITY interferometer. Reconnection near the horizon produces sufﬁciently energetic plasma to explain ﬂares from accreting black holes, such as the TeV emission observed from M87. The drop in the mass accretion rate during the ﬂare and the resulting low-density magnetosphere make it easier for very-highenergy photons produced by reconnection-accelerated particles to escape. The extreme-resolution results in a converged plasmoid-mediated reconnection rate that directly determines the timescales and properties of the ﬂare.},

The method is straightforward to implement, is computationally efficient, has little memory requirements, is invariant to diagonal rescaling of the gradients, and is well suited for problems that are large in terms of data and/or parameters. The method is also appropriate for non-stationary objectives and problems with very noisy and/or sparse gradients. The hyper-parameters have intuitive interpretations and typically require little tuning. Some connections to related algorithms, on which Adam was inspired, are discussed. We also analyze the theoretical convergence properties of the algorithm and provide a regret bound on the convergence rate that is comparable to the best known results under the online convex optimization framework. Empirical results demonstrate that Adam works well in practice and compares favorably to other stochastic optimization methods. Finally, we discuss AdaMax, a variant of Adam based on the infinity norm.},

	abstract = {Since deep neural networks were developed, they have made huge contributions to everyday lives. Machine learning provides more rational advice than humans are capable of in almost every aspect of daily life. However, despite this achievement, the design and training of neural networks are still challenging and unpredictable procedures. To lower the technical thresholds for common users, automated hyper-parameter optimization (HPO) has become a popular topic in both academic and industrial areas. This paper provides a review of the most essential topics on HPO. The first section introduces the key hyper-parameters related to model training and structure, and discusses their importance and methods to define the value range. Then, the research focuses on major optimization algorithms and their applicability, covering their efficiency and accuracy especially for deep learning networks. This study next reviews major services and toolkits for HPO, comparing their support for state-of-the-art searching algorithms, feasibility with major deep learning frameworks, and extensibility for new modules designed by users. The paper concludes with problems that exist when HPO is applied to deep learning, a comparison between optimization algorithms, and prominent approaches for model evaluation with limited computational resources.},

	abstract = {A multilayer perceptron is a feedforward artificial neural network model that maps sets of input data onto a set of appropriate output. It is a modification of the standard linear perceptron in that it uses three or more layers of neurons (nodes) with nonlinear activation functions, and is more powerful than the perceptron in that it can distinguish data that is not linearly separable, or separable by a hyper plane. MLP networks are general-purpose, flexible, nonlinear models consisting of a number of units organised into multiple layers. The complexity of the MLP network can be changed by varying the number of layers and the number of units in each layer. Given enough hidden units and enough data, it has been shown that MLPs can approximate virtually any function to any desired accuracy. This paper presents the performance comparison between Multi-layer Perceptron (back propagation, delta rule and perceptron). Perceptron is a steepest descent type algorithm that normally has slow convergence rate and the search for the global minimum often becomes trapped at poor local minima. The current study investigates the performance of three algorithms to train MLP networks. Its was found that the Perceptron algorithm are much better than others algorithms.},

	abstract = {Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) is a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm that avoids the random walk behavior and sensitivity to correlated parameters that plague many MCMC methods by taking a series of steps informed by ﬁrst-order gradient information. These features allow it to converge to high-dimensional target distributions much more quickly than simpler methods such as random walk Metropolis or Gibbs sampling. However, HMC’s performance is highly sensitive to two user-speciﬁed parameters: a step size and a desired number of steps L. In particular, if L is too small then the algorithm exhibits undesirable random walk behavior, while if L is too large the algorithm wastes computation. We introduce the No-U-Turn Sampler (NUTS), an extension to HMC that eliminates the need to set a number of steps L. NUTS uses a recursive algorithm to build a set of likely candidate points that spans a wide swath of the target distribution, stopping automatically when it starts to double back and retrace its steps. Empirically, NUTS performs at least as eﬃciently as (and sometimes more eﬃciently than) a well tuned standard HMC method, without requiring user intervention or costly tuning runs. We also derive a method for adapting the step size parameter on the ﬂy based on primal-dual averaging. NUTS can thus be used with no hand-tuning at all, making it suitable for applications such as BUGS-style automatic inference engines that require eﬃcient “turnkey” samplers.},

	abstract = {The hard state of X-ray binaries (XRBs) is characterized by a power-law spectrum in the X-ray band and a flat/inverted radio/IR spectrum associated with occasionally imaged compact jets. It has generally been thought that the hard X-rays result from Compton upscattering of thermal accretion disk photons by a hot, coronal plasma whose properties are inferred via spectral fitting. Interestingly, these properties-especially those from certain magnetized corona models-are very similar to the derived plasma conditions at the jet footpoints. Here we explore the question of whether the ``corona'' and ``jet base'' are in fact related, starting by testing the strongest premise that they are synonymous. In such models, the radio through the soft X-rays are dominated by synchrotron emission, while the hard X-rays are dominated by inverse Compton at the jet base-with both disk and synchrotron photons acting as seed photons. The conditions at the jet base fix the conditions along the rest of the jet, thus creating a direct link between the X-ray and radio emission. We also add to this model a simple iron line and convolve the spectrum with neutral reflection. After forward-folding the predicted spectra through the detector response functions, we compare the results to simultaneous radio/X-ray data obtained from the hard states of the Galactic XRBs GX 339-4 and Cygnus X-1. Results from simple Compton corona model fits are also presented for comparison. We demonstrate that the jet model fits are statistically as good as the single-component corona model X-ray fits, yet are also able to address the simultaneous radio data.},

	abstract = {Often, machine learning applications have to cope with dynamic environments where data are collected in the form of continuous data streams with potentially infinite length and transient behavior. Compared to traditional (batch) data mining, stream processing algorithms have additional requirements regarding computational resources and adaptability to data evolution. They must process instances incrementally because the data’s continuous flow prohibits storing data for multiple passes. Ensemble learning achieved remarkable predictive performance in this scenario. Implemented as a set of (several) individual classifiers, ensembles are naturally amendable for task parallelism. However, the incremental learning and dynamic data structures used to capture the concept drift increase the cache misses and hinder the benefit of parallelism. This paper proposes a mini-batching strategy that can improve memory access locality and performance of several ensemble algorithms for stream mining in multi-core environments. With the aid of a formal framework, we demonstrate that mini-batching can significantly decrease the reuse distance (and the number of cache misses). Experiments on six different state-of-the-art ensemble algorithms applying four benchmark datasets with varied characteristics show speedups of up to 5X on 8-core processors. These benefits come at the expense of a small reduction in predictive performance.},

	abstract = {While logistic sigmoid neurons are more biologically plausible than hyperbolic tangent neurons, the latter work better for training multi-layer neural networks. This paper shows that rectifying neurons are an even better model of biological neurons and yield equal or better performance than hyperbolic tangent networks in spite of the hard non-linearity and non-diﬀerentiability at zero, creating sparse representations with true zeros, which seem remarkably suitable for naturally sparse data. Even though they can take advantage of semi-supervised setups with extra-unlabeled data, deep rectiﬁer networks can reach their best performance without requiring any unsupervised pre-training on purely supervised tasks with large labeled datasets. Hence, these results can be seen as a new milestone in the attempts at understanding the diﬃculty in training deep but purely supervised neural networks, and closing the performance gap between neural networks learnt with and without unsupervised pre-training.},

	abstract = {We present three-dimensional simulations with nested meshes of the dynamics of the gas around a Jupiter mass planet with the JUPITER and FARGOCA codes. We implemented a radiative transfer module into the JUPITER code to account for realistic heating and cooling of the gas. We focus on the circumplanetary gas ﬂow, determining its characteristics at very high resolution (80\% of Jupiter’s diameter). In our nominal simulation where the temperature evolves freely by the radiative module and reaches 13000 K at the planet, a circumplanetary envelope was formed ﬁlling the entire Roche-lobe. Because of our equation of state is simpliﬁed and probably overestimates the temperature, we also performed simulations with limited maximal temperatures in the planet region (1000 K, 1500 K, and 2000 K). In these ﬁxed temperature cases circumplanetary disks (CPDs) were formed. This suggests that the capability to form a circumplanetary disk is not simply linked to the mass of the planet and its ability to open a gap. Instead, the gas temperature at the planet’s location, which depends on its accretion history, plays also fundamental role. The CPDs in the simulations are hot and cooling very slowly, they have very steep temperature and density proﬁles, and are strongly sub-Keplerian. Moreover, the CPDs are fed by a strong vertical inﬂux, which shocks on the CPD surfaces creating a hot and luminous shock-front. In contrast, the pressure supported circumplanetary envelope is characterized by internal convection and almost stalled rotation.},

	abstract = {Substructures are ubiquitous in high resolution (sub-)millimeter continuum observations of circumstellar disks. They are possibly caused by forming planets embedded in their disk. To investigate the relation between observed substructures and young planets, we perform novel three-dimensional two-ﬂuid (gas+1-mm-dust) hydrodynamic simulations of circumstellar disks with embedded planets (Neptune-, Saturn-, Jupiter-, 5 Jupiter-mass) at diﬀerent orbital distances from the star (5.2AU, 30AU, 50AU). We turn these simulations into synthetic (sub)millimeter ALMA images. We ﬁnd that all but the Neptune-mass planet open annular gaps in both the gas and the dust component of the disk. We ﬁnd that the temporal evolution of the dust density distribution is distinctly diﬀerent from the gas’. For example, the planets cause signiﬁcant vertical stirring of the dust in the circumstellar disk which opposes the vertical settling. This creates a thicker dust disk than disks without a planet. We ﬁnd that this eﬀect greatly inﬂuences the dust masses derived from the synthetic ALMA images. Comparing the dust disk masses in the 3D simulations and the ones derived from the 2D ALMA synthetic images, we ﬁnd the former to be a factor of a few (up to 10) larger, pointing to that real disks might be signiﬁcantly more massive than previously thought based on ALMA continuum images using the optically thin assumption and equation. Finally, we analyze the synthetic ALMA images and provide an empirical relationship between the planet mass and the width of the gap in the ALMA images, including the eﬀects of the beam size.},

	abstract = {We present ForwardDiff, a Julia package for forward-mode automatic differentiation (AD) featuring performance competitive with low-level languages like C++. Unlike recently developed AD tools in other popular high-level languages such as Python and MATLAB, ForwardDiff takes advantage of just-in-time (JIT) compilation to transparently recompile AD-unaware user code, enabling efficient support for higher-order differentiation and differentiation using custom number types (including complex numbers). For gradient and Jacobian calculations, ForwardDiff provides a variant of vector-forward mode that avoids expensive heap allocation and makes better use of memory bandwidth than traditional vector mode. In our numerical experiments, we demonstrate that for nontrivially large dimensions, ForwardDiff's gradient computations can be faster than a reverse-mode implementation from the Python-based autograd package. We also illustrate how ForwardDiff is used effectively within JuMP, a modeling language for optimization. According to our usage statistics, 41 unique repositories on GitHub depend on ForwardDiff, with users from diverse fields such as astronomy, optimization, finite element analysis, and statistics.

To present those characteristics for both linear and non-linear methods, we combine visualization of the Voronoi based representation of multi-dimensional decision boundaries in scatterplots with visualization of the distances to the multi-dimensional boundary of all the data elements. We use interactive decision point selection on the ROC curve to allow the decision maker to reﬁne the threshold of the classiﬁcation model and instantly observe the results.

	abstract = {Studies of cosmology, galaxy evolution, and astronomical transients with current and next-generation wide-field imaging surveys (like LSST) are all critically dependent on estimates of galaxy redshifts from imaging data alone. Capsule networks are a new type of neural network architecture that is better suited for identifying morphological features of the input images than traditional convolutional neural networks. We use a deep capsule network trained on the \$ugriz\$ images, spectroscopic redshifts, and Galaxy Zoo spiral/elliptical classifications of \${\textbackslash}sim\$400,000 SDSS galaxies to do photometric redshift estimation. We achieve a photometric redshift prediction accuracy and a fraction of catastrophic outliers that are comparable to or better than current state-of-the-art methods while requiring less data and fewer trainable parameters. Furthermore, the decision-making of our capsule network is much more easily interpretable as capsules act as a low-dimensional encoding of the image. When the capsules are projected on a 2-dimensional manifold, they form a single redshift sequence with the fraction of spirals in a region exhibiting a gradient roughly perpendicular to the redshift sequence. We perturb encodings of real galaxy images in this low-dimensional space to create synthetic galaxy images that demonstrate the image properties (e.g., size, orientation, and surface brightness) encoded by each dimension. We also show how strongly galaxy properties (e.g., magnitudes, colours, and stellar mass) are correlated with each capsule dimension. Finally, we publicly release the code for our capsule network, our estimated redshifts, and additional catalogues.},

The AI structure is built around VPFIT, a well-developed and extensively tested nonlinear least-squares code. The new method forms a sophisticated parallelized system, eliminating human decision-making and hence bias. Here, we describe the workings of such a system and apply it to synthetic spectra, in doing so establishing recommended methodologies for future analyses of Very Large Telescope (VLT) and Extremely Large Telescope (ELT) data. One important result is that modelling line broadening for high-redshift absorption components should include both thermal and turbulent components. Failing to do so means it is easy to derive the wrong model and hence incorrect parameter estimates. One topical application of our method concerns searches for spatial or temporal variations in fundamental constants. This subject is one of the key science drivers for the European Southern Observatory's ESPRESSO spectrograph on the VLT and for the HIRES spectrograph on the ELT. The quality of new data demands completely objective and reproducible methods. The Monte Carlo aspects of the new method described here reveal that model non-uniqueness can be significant, indicating that it is unrealistic to expect to derive an unambiguous estimate of the fine structure constant α from one or a very small number of measurements. No matter how optimal the modelling method, it is a fundamental requirement to use a large sample of measurements to meaningfully constrain temporal or spatial α variation.},

We embark on a fully relativistic computation of this effect and calculate the iron line profile in the framework of a specific model in which rotating, highly ionized and resonantly absorbing plasma occurs close to the black hole. This can explain the features seen in the iron Kα line profile recently obtained by Nandra et al. for the type 1 Seyfert galaxy NGC 3516. We show that the redshift of this feature can be mainly gravitational in origin and accounted for without the need to invoke fast accretion of matter on to the black hole.

The simplest notional geometry being analyzed as part of the DARPA-funded work consists of a standard parallel plate Casimir cavity equipped with pillars arrayed along the cavity mid-plane with the purpose of detecting a transient electric ﬁeld arising from vacuum polarization conjectured to occur along the midplane of the cavity. An analytic technique called worldline numerics was adapted to numerically assess vacuum response to the custom Casimir cavity, and these numerical analysis results were observed to be qualitatively quite similar to a two-dimensional representation of energy density requirements for the Alcubierre warp metric. Subsequently, a toy model consisting of a 1 µm diameter sphere centrally located in a 4 µm diameter cylinder was analyzed to show a three-dimensional Casimir energy density that correlates well with the Alcubierre warp metric requirements. This qualitative correlation would suggest that chip-scale experiments might be explored to attempt to measure tiny signatures illustrative of the presence of the conjectured phenomenon: a real, albeit humble, warp bubble.},

Among self-rated papers expressing a position on AGW, 97.2\% endorsed the consensus. For both abstract ratings and authors’ self-ratings, the percentage of endorsements among papers expressing a position on AGW marginally increased over time.

Although integrable in principle, test-particle orbits in the Kerr spacetime can also be elaborate, and while they have been studied extensively, classifying their general properties has been a challenge. This is the first in a series of papers that adopts a dynamical systems approach to the study of Kerr orbits, beginning with equatorial orbits. We define a taxonomy of orbits that hinges on a correspondence between periodic orbits and rational numbers. The taxonomy defines the entire dynamics, including aperiodic motion, since every orbit is in or near the periodic set. A remarkable implication of this periodic orbit taxonomy is that the simple precessing ellipse familiar from planetary orbits is not allowed in the strong-field regime. Instead, eccentric orbits trace out precessions of multileaf clovers in the final stages of inspiral. Furthermore, for any black hole, there is some point in the strong-field regime past which zoom-whirl behavior becomes unavoidable. Finally, we sketch the potential application of the taxonomy to problems of astrophysical interest, in particular its utility for computationally intensive gravitational wave calculations.},

We find that the SANE models produce short-timescale variability with amplitudes and power spectra that closely resemble those inferred observationally. In contrast, MAD models generate only slow variability at lower flux levels. Neither set of models shows any X-ray flares, which most likely indicates that additional physics, such as particle acceleration mechanisms, need to be incorporated into the GRMHD simulations to account for them. The SANE models show strong, short-lived millimeter/infrared (IR) flares, with short (≲1 hr) time lags between the millimeter and IR wavelengths, that arise from the combination of short-lived magnetic flux tubes and strong-field gravitational lensing near the horizon. Such events provide a natural explanation for the observed IR flares with no X-ray counterparts.},

	abstract = {Recent advances in general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic simulations have expanded and improved our understanding of the dynamics of black-hole accretion disks. However, current simulations do not capture the thermodynamics of electrons in the low density accreting plasma. This poses a significant challenge in predicting accretion flow images and spectra from first principles. Because of this, simplified emission models have often been used, with widely different configurations (e.g., disk- versus jet-dominated emission), and were able to account for the observed spectral properties of accreting black holes. Exploring the large parameter space introduced by such models, however, requires significant computational power that exceeds conventional computational facilities. In this paper, we use GRay, a fast graphics processing unit (GPU) based ray-tracing algorithm, on the GPU cluster El Gato, to compute images and spectra for a set of six general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic simulations with different magnetic field configurations and black-hole spins. We also employ two different parametric models for the plasma thermodynamics in each of the simulations. We show that, if only the spectral properties of Sgr A* are used, all 12 models tested here can fit the spectra equally well. However, when combined with the measurement of the image size of the emission using the Event Horizon Telescope, current observations rule out all models with strong funnel emission, because the funnels are typically very extended. Our study shows that images of accretion flows with horizon-scale resolution offer a powerful tool in understanding accretion flows around black holes and their thermodynamic properties.},

In this paper, we consider the possibility that they are exotic compact objects and we describe their exterior gravitational field with a subclass of the Manko-Novikov metrics, which are exact solutions of the vacuum Einstein's equations and can describe the spacetime geometry around bodies with arbitrary mass-multipole moments. We point out that around a Manko-Novikov object there may exist many disconnected non-plunging regions at small radii, with no counterpart in the Kerr background, and that their existence may be tested. For instance, in the presence of an accretion disk, they may be filled by the accreting gas, forming a ring structure that might remind the rings of Saturn. We suggest that the existence of these regions may have a clear observational signature in the waveform of the gravitational radiation emitted by an EMRI: in the last stage of the inspiral, the waveform would be the combination of "regular chirps", produced when the small object orbits in one of the non-plunging regions, and "bursts", released when the small object jumps from a non-plunging region to another one at smaller radii. Our conclusions are supported by some numerical calculations of trajectories in the geodesic approximation, in which a particle plunges from the ISCO and then seems to get trapped in the potential well at smaller radii.},

The peak performance of GRay using single-precision floating-point arithmetic on a single GPU exceeds 300 GFLOP (or 1 ns per photon per time step). For a realistic problem, where the peak performance cannot be reached, GRay is two orders of magnitude faster than existing central-processing-unit-based ray-tracing codes. This performance enhancement allows more effective searches of large parameter spaces when comparing theoretical predictions of images, spectra, and light curves from the vicinities of compact objects to observations. GRay can also perform on-the-fly ray tracing within general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic algorithms that simulate accretion flows around compact objects. Making use of this algorithm, we calculate the properties of the shadows of Kerr black holes and the photon rings that surround them. We also provide accurate fitting formulae of their dependencies on black hole spin and observer inclination, which can be used to interpret upcoming observations of the black holes at the center of the Milky Way, as well as M87, with the Event Horizon Telescope.},

These black holes are located in two distinct classes of X-ray binary systems, one that is persistently X-ray bright and another that is transient. Both the persistent and transient black holes remain for long periods in a state where their spectra are dominated by a thermal accretion disk component. The spin of a black hole of known mass and distance can be measured by fitting this thermal continuum spectrum to the thin-disk model of Novikov and Thorne; the key fit parameter is the radius of the inner edge of the black hole's accretion disk. Strong observational and theoretical evidence links the inner-disk radius to the radius of the innermost stable circular orbit, which is trivially related to the dimensionless spin parameter a ∗ of the black hole ({\textbar} a ∗{\textbar}{\textless}1). The ten spins that have so far been measured by this continuum-fitting method range widely from a ∗≈0 to a ∗{\textgreater}0.95. The robustness of the method is demonstrated by the dozens or hundreds of independent and consistent measurements of spin that have been obtained for several black holes, and through careful consideration of many sources of systematic error. Among the results discussed is a dichotomy between the transient and persistent black holes; the latter have higher spins and larger masses. Also discussed is recently discovered evidence in the transient sources for a correlation between the power of ballistic jets and black hole spin.},

In this manuscript we develop an infrastructure for incorporating deep learning into existing scientiﬁc computing code through Differentiable Programming (∂P ). We describe a ∂P system that is able to take gradients of full Julia programs, making Automatic Differentiation a ﬁrst class language feature and compatibility with deep learning pervasive. Our system utilizes the one-language nature of Julia package development to augment the existing package ecosystem with deep learning, supporting almost all language constructs (control ﬂow, recursion, mutation, etc.) while generating highperformance code without requiring any user intervention or refactoring to stage computations. We showcase several examples of physics-informed learning which directly utilizes this extension to existing simulation code: neural surrogate models, machine learning on simulated quantum hardware, and data-driven stochastic dynamical model discovery with neural stochastic differential equations.},

We propose to solve highdimensional PDEs by approximating the solution with a deep neural network which is trained to satisfy the diﬀerential operator, initial condition, and boundary conditions. Our algorithm is meshfree, which is key since meshes become infeasible in higher dimensions. Instead of forming a mesh, the neural network is trained on batches of randomly sampled time and space points. The algorithm is tested on a class of high-dimensional free boundary PDEs, which we are able to accurately solve in up to 200 dimensions. The algorithm is also tested on a high-dimensional Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman PDE and Burgers’ equation. The deep learning algorithm approximates the general solution to the Burgers’ equation for a continuum of diﬀerent boundary conditions and physical conditions (which can be viewed as a high-dimensional space).

	abstract = {Learning can be seen as approximating an unknown function by interpolating the training data. Kriging oﬀers a solution to this problem based on the prior speciﬁcation of a kernel. We explore a numerical approximation approach to kernel selection/construction based on the simple premise that a kernel must be good if the number of interpolation points can be halved without signiﬁcant loss in accuracy (measured using the intrinsic RKHS norm · associated with the kernel). We ﬁrst test and motivate this idea on a simple problem of recovering the Green’s function of an elliptic PDE (with inhomogeneous coeﬃcients) from the sparse observation of one of its solutions. Next we consider the problem of learning non-parametric families of deep kernels of the form K1(Fn(x), Fn(x )) with Fn+1 = (Id + Gn+1) ◦ Fn and Gn+1 ∈ span\{K1(Fn(xi), ·)\}. With the proposed approach constructing the kernel becomes equivalent to integrating a stochastic data driven dynamical system, which allows for the training of very deep (bottomless) networks and the exploration of their properties. These networks learn by constructing ﬂow maps in the kernel and input spaces via incremental data-dependent deformations/perturbations (appearing as the cooperative counterpart of adversarial examples) and, at profound depths, they (1) can achieve accurate classiﬁcation from only one data point per class (2) appear to learn archetypes of each class (3) expand distances between points that are in diﬀerent classes and contract distances between points in the same class.},

The sparse identification of nonlinear dynamics (SINDy) algorithm is one approach to discover dynamical systems models from data. Although extensions have been developed to identify implicit dynamics, or dynamics described by rational functions, these extensions are extremely sensitive to noise. In this work, we develop SINDy-PI (parallel, implicit), a robust variant of the SINDy algorithm to identify implicit dynamics and rational nonlinearities. The SINDy-PI framework includes multiple optimization algorithms and a principled approach to model selection. We demonstrate the ability of this algorithm to learn implicit ordinary and partial differential equations and conservation laws from limited and noisy data. In particular, we show that the proposed approach is several orders of magnitude more noise robust than previous approaches, and may be used to identify a class of ODE and PDE dynamics that were previously unattainable with SINDy, including for the double pendulum dynamics and simplified model for the Belousov–Zhabotinsky (BZ) reaction.},

The resulting neural networks form a new class of data-eﬃcient universal function approximators that naturally encode any underlying physical laws as prior information.

Advances in sparse regression are currently enabling the tractable identification of both the structure and parameters of a nonlinear dynamical system from data. The resulting models have the fewest terms necessary to describe the dynamics, balancing model complexity with descriptive ability, and thus promoting interpretability and generalizability. This provides an algorithmic approach to Occam’s razor for model discovery. However, this approach fundamentally relies on an effective coordinate system in which the dynamics have a simple representation. In this work, we design a custom deep autoencoder network to discover a coordinate transformation into a reduced space where the dynamics may be sparsely represented. Thus, we simultaneously learn the governing equations and the associated coordinate system. We demonstrate this approach on several example high-dimensional systems with low-dimensional behavior. The resulting modeling framework combines the strengths of deep neural networks for flexible representation and sparse identification of nonlinear dynamics (SINDy) for parsimonious models. This method places the discovery of coordinates and models on an equal footing.},

Data are abundant whereas models often remain elusive, as in climate science, neuroscience, ecology, finance, and epidemiology, to name only a few examples. In this work, we combine sparsity-promoting techniques and machine learning with nonlinear dynamical systems to discover governing equations from noisy measurement data. The only assumption about the structure of the model is that there are only a few important terms that govern the dynamics, so that the equations are sparse in the space of possible functions; this assumption holds for many physical systems in an appropriate basis. In particular, we use sparse regression to determine the fewest terms in the dynamic governing equations required to accurately represent the data. This results in parsimonious models that balance accuracy with model complexity to avoid overfitting. We demonstrate the algorithm on a wide range of problems, from simple canonical systems, including linear and nonlinear oscillators and the chaotic Lorenz system, to the fluid vortex shedding behind an obstacle. The fluid example illustrates the ability of this method to discover the underlying dynamics of a system that took experts in the community nearly 30 years to resolve. We also show that this method generalizes to parameterized systems and systems that are time-varying or have external forcing.},

Most existing integration algorithms employ Boyer–Lindquist (BL) coordinates, which have coordinate singularities at the event horizon and along the poles. Handling the singularities requires special numerical treatment in these regions, often slows down the calculations, and may lead to inaccurate geodesics. We present here a new general-purpose geodesic integrator, GRay2, that overcomes these issues by employing the Cartesian form of Kerr–Schild (KS) coordinates. By performing particular mathematical manipulations of the geodesic equations and several optimizations, we develop an implementation of the Cartesian KS coordinates that outperforms calculations that use the seemingly simpler equations in BL coordinates. We also employ the OpenCL framework, which allows GRay2 to run on multicore CPUs as well as on a wide range of graphics processing units hardware accelerators, making the algorithm more versatile. We report numerous convergence tests and benchmark results for GRay2 for both time-like (particle) and null (photon) geodesics.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/2110.11837},
	abstract = {Thermal phase curves of exoplanet atmospheres have revealed temperature maps as a function of planetary longitude, often by sinusoidal decomposition of the phase curve. We construct a framework for describing two-dimensional temperature maps of exoplanets with mathematical basis functions derived for a ﬂuid layer on a rotating, heated sphere with drag/friction, which are generalisations of spherical harmonics. These basis functions naturally produce physically-motivated temperature maps for exoplanets with few free parameters. We investigate best practices for applying this framework to temperature maps of hot Jupiters by splitting the problem into two parts: (1) we constrain the temperature map as a function of latitude by tuning the basis functions to reproduce general circulation model (GCM) outputs, since disk-integrated phase curve observations do not constrain this dimension; and (2) we infer the temperature maps of real hot Jupiters using original reductions of several Spitzer phase curves, which directly constrain the temperature variations with longitude. The resulting phase curves can be described with only three free parameters per bandpass – an eﬃciency improvement over the usual ﬁve or so used to describe sinusoidal decompositions of phase curves. Upon obtaining the hemispherically averaged dayside and nightside temperatures, the standard approach would be to use zero-dimensional box models to infer the Bond albedo and redistribution eﬃciency. We elucidate the limitation of these box models by demonstrating that negative Bond albedos may be obtained due to a choice of boundary condition on the nightside temperature. We propose generalized deﬁnitions for the Bond albedo and heat redistribution eﬃciency for use with two-dimensional (2D) temperature maps. Open-source software called kelp is provided to eﬃciently compute the 2D temperature maps, phase curves, albedos and redistribution eﬃciencies.},

Using Weierstrass's and Jacobi's elliptic functions, we express all coordinates and affine parameters as analytical and numerical functions of a parameter p, which is an integral value along the geodesic. This is the main difference between our code and previous similar ones. The advantage of this treatment is that the information about the turning points does not need to be specified in advance by the user, and many applications such as imaging, the calculation of line profiles, and the observer-emitter problem, become root-finding problems. All elliptic integrations are computed by Carlson's elliptic integral method as in Dexter \& Agol, which guarantees the fast computational speed of our code. The formulae to compute the constants of motion given by Cunningham \& Bardeen have been extended, which allow one to readily handle situations in which the emitter or the observer has an arbitrary distance from, and motion state with respect to, the central compact object. The validation of the code has been extensively tested through applications to toy problems from the literature.

	abstract = {The narrow-line Seyfert 1 galaxy 1H0707−495 has shown the ﬁrst clear evidence of X-ray reverberation in which the soft, disc-reﬂection and Fe-L-dominated 0.3–1 keV band lags behind the hard, continuum-dominated 1–4 keV band by ≈ 30 s. A simple reﬂection model, however, cannot explain the different amplitudes of variability between the continuum and reﬂection components in time-resolved spectra. Here we apply a light-bending model (LBM) to 1H0707−495 to determine whether or not it can fully account for both the timeaveraged spectrum and observed X-ray variability and time lags. A point-like source is assumed to move vertically from 3.5rg to 8rg approximately along the rotation axis of the black hole. Photon paths are integrated via a numerical method for each source position to calculate the corresponding direct and ionized reﬂection spectra from the accretion disc. The source is assumed to move up and down in such a way as to reproduce the 1–4 keV light curve from the XMM–Newton observations. We ﬁnd that, even though the reproduced time-averaged spectrum generally agrees with the observations, this LBM cannot account for the observed time lags between the continuum and reﬂection spectrum. Furthermore, timing properties such as coherence are sensitive to the ionization state of the inner disc. We conclude that a more complex model of the source geometry and intrinsic variability are required, and probably one in which ﬂuctuations propagating through the disc are directly associated with the X-ray sources. Our ionized reverberation mapping model is completely general, allowing other scenarios to be investigated in the future. Reverberation signatures are beginning to constrain the true nature of the X-ray source of not only 1H0707−495, but also other active galactic nuclei.},

The model includes the effects of Compton up-scattering between the disc ultraviolet (UV) photons and coronal electrons, and the subsequent X-ray reverberation from the disc. The time lags are associated with the time required for multiple scatterings to boost UV photons up to soft and hard X-ray energies, and the light crossing time the photons take to reach the observer. This model can reproduce not only low-frequency hard and high-frequency soft lags, but also the clear bumps and wiggles in reverberation proﬁles, which should explain the wavy residuals currently observed in some AGNs. Our model supports an anti-correlation between the optical depth and coronal temperatures. In case of an optically thin corona, time delays due to propagating ﬂuctuations may be required to reproduce observed time lags. We ﬁt the model to the lag-frequency data of 1H0707–495, Ark 564, NGC 4051, and IRAS 13224–3809 estimated using the minimal bias technique so that the observed lags here are highest-possible quality. We ﬁnd that their corona size is ∼7–15rg having the constrained optical depth ∼2–10. The coronal temperature is ∼150–300 keV. Finally, we note that the reverberation wiggles may be signatures of repeating scatters inside the corona that control the distribution of X-ray sources.},

The correlation between direction of emission in the frame comoving with the source and the asymptotic direction of a beam of radiation gives the time-averaged energy flux as a function of polar angle.

	abstract = {We analyze two 3D general-relativistic magnetohydrodynamic accretion simulations in the context of how they would manifest in Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) observations of supermassive black holes. The two simulations differ only in whether the initial angular momentum of the plasma is aligned with the rapid (a = 0.9) spin of the black hole. Both have low net magnetic flux. Ray tracing is employed to generate resolved images of the synchrotron emission. When using parameters appropriate for Sgr A* and assuming a viewing angle aligned with the black hole spin, we find the most prominent difference is that the central shadow in the image is noticeably eccentric in tilted models, with the ring of emission relatively unchanged. Applying this procedure to M87 with a viewing angle based on the large-scale jet, we find that adding tilt increases the angular size of the ring for fixed black hole mass and distance, while at the same time increasing the number of bright spots in the image. Our findings illustrate observable features that can distinguish tilted from aligned flows. They also show that tilted models can be viable for M87, and that not accounting for tilt can bias inferences of physical parameters. Future modeling of horizon-scale observations should account for potential angular momentum misalignment, which is likely generic at the low accretion rates appropriate for EHT targets.},

Comparing the EHT observed image with images based on numerical simulations of BH accretion flows suggests that on average the projected BH spin axis should be oriented SSW {\textbackslash}citep\{2019ApJ...875L...5E\}. Alternatively, if the spin axis is matched with the jet direction, emission from the SEE sector of the photon ring can only be accounted for as a temporary fluctuation. We explore highly simplified toy models for geometric distribution and kinematics of emitting regions in the Kerr metric, and perform ray tracing to calculate images. We strictly assume that: (1) the BH spin vector is fixed to the jet axis (position angle \$\{{\textbackslash}rm PA\}\_\{{\textbackslash}rm jet\} = 288{\textasciicircum}{\textbackslash}circ\$, inclination \$i = 162{\textasciicircum}{\textbackslash}circ\$), (2) the emitting regions are stationary and symmetric with respect to the BH spin, (3) the emissivities are isotropic in the local rest frames. Emission from the crescent sector SSE - SWW can be readily explained in terms of an equatorial ring with either circular or plunging geodesic flows, regardless of the value of BH spin. In the case of plane-symmetric polar caps with plunging geodesic flows, the dominant image of the cap located behind the BH is sensitive to the angular momentum of the emitter. Within the constraints of our model, we have not found a viable explanation for the observed brightness of the SEE sector. We conclude that the SEE emission should indeed be interpreted as a temporary departure from intrinsic axial symmetry of the inner accretion flow.},

	abstract = {We present a formulation for a local cooling function to be employed in the diffuse, hot corona region of 3D GRMHD simulations of accreting black holes. This new cooling function calculates the cooling rate due to inverse Compton scattering by considering the relevant microphysics in each cell in the corona and approximating the radiation energy density and Compton temperature thereby integrating over the thermal seed photon flux from the disk surface. The method either assumes the ion and electron temperatures are equal (1T) or calculates them separately (2T) using an instantaneous equilibrium approach predicated on the actual relevant rate equations (Coulomb and Compton). The method is shown to be consistent with a more detailed ray-tracing calculation where the bulk of the cooling occurs, but is substantially less costly to perform. As an example, we apply these methods to a HARM3D simulation of a 10M⊙, non-spinning black hole, accreting at nominally 1\% the Eddington value. This new approach leads to radiative efficiency values ≃65\% above Novikov-Thorne, with a larger fraction of total cooling in the corona as compared to simulations performed using the original target-temperature cooling function. Time-averaged post-processing reveals that the continuum spectral observations predicted from these simulations are qualitatively similar to actual X-ray binary data, especially so for the 1T approach, which yields a harder power-law component (Γ = 2.25) compared to the 2T version (Γ = 2.53).},

	abstract = {Emission from an accretion disc around compact objects, such as neutron stars and black holes, is expected to be significantly polarized. The polarization can be used to put constraints on geometrical and physical parameters of the compact sources -- their radii, masses and spins -- as well as to determine the orbital parameters. The radiation escaping from the innermost parts of the disc is strongly affected by the gravitational field of the compact object and relativistic velocities of the matter. The straightforward calculation of the observed polarization signatures involves computationally expensive ray-tracing technique. At the same time, having fast computational routines for direct data fitting becomes increasingly important in light of the currently observed images of the accretion flow around supermassive black hole in M87 by the Event Horizon Telescope, infrared polarization signatures coming from Sgr A*, as well as for the upcoming X-ray polarization measurements by the Imaging X-ray Polarimetry Explorer and enhanced X-ray Timing and Polarimetry mission. In this work, we obtain an exact analytical expression for the rotation angle of polarization plane in Schwarzschild metric accounting for the effects of light bending and relativistic aberration. We show that the calculation of the observed flux, polarization degree and polarization angle as a function of energy can be performed analytically with high accuracy using approximate light-bending formula, lifting the need for the pre-computed tabular models in fitting routines.},

	abstract = {The fluorescent iron Kα line is a powerful observational probe of the inner regions of black hole accretion disks. Previous studies have assumed that only material outside the radius of marginal stability (r = 6m for a Schwarzschild hole) can contribute to the observed line emission. Here we show that fluorescence by material inside the radius of marginal stability, which is in the process of spiraling toward the event horizon, can have an observable influence on the iron line profile and equivalent width. For concreteness, we consider the case of a geometrically thin accretion disk, around a Schwarzschild black hole, in which fluorescence is excited by an X-ray source placed at some height above the disk and on the axis of the disk. Fully relativistic line profiles are presented for various source heights and efficiencies. It is found that the extra line flux generally emerges in the extreme red wing of the iron line, because of the large gravitational redshift experienced by photons from the region within the radius of marginal stability. We apply our models to the variable iron line seen in the ASCA spectrum of the Seyfert nucleus MCG -6-30-15. It is found that the change in the line profile, equivalent width, and continuum normalization can be well explained as being due to a change in the height of the source above the disk. Thus, we can explain the iron line properties of MCG -6-30-15 within the context of an accretion disk around a nonrotating black hole. This contrasts with previous studies that, due to the absence of fluorescence from within the radius of marginal stability, have indicated that this object possesses a rapidly rotating (i.e., near-extremal Kerr) black hole. This is an important issue since it has a direct bearing on the spin paradigm for the radio-loud/radio-quiet dichotomy seen in accreting black hole systems. We discuss some future observational tests that could help distinguish slowly rotating black holes from rapidly rotating holes.},

In the XMM-Newton data, we find a strong peak in the first principal component at the energy of the Fe absorption line from the highly blueshifted outflow. This indicates that the absorption feature is more variable than the continuum, and that it is responding to the continuum. We find qualitatively different behaviour in the Suzaku data, which is dominated by changes in the column density of neutral absorption. In this case, we find no evidence of the absorption produced by the highly ionized gas being correlated with this variability. Additionally, we perform simulations of the source variability, and demonstrate that PCA can trivially distinguish between outflow variability correlated, anticorrelated and un-correlated with the continuum flux. Here, the observed anticorrelation between the absorption line equivalent width and the continuum flux may be due to the ionization of the wind responding to the continuum. Finally, we compare our results with those found in the narrow-line Seyfert 1 IRAS 13224-3809. We find that the Fe K UFO feature is sharper and more prominent in PDS 456, but that it lacks the lower energy features from lighter elements found in IRAS 13224-3809, presumably due to differences in ionization.},

	abstract = {This paper addresses the problem of detecting and characterizing local variability in time series and other forms of sequential data. The goal is to identify and characterize statistically significant variations, at the same time suppressing the inevitable corrupting observational errors. We present a simple nonparametric modeling technique and an algorithm implementing it - an improved and generalized version of Bayesian Blocks (Scargle 1998) - that finds the optimal segmentation of the data in the observation interval. The structure of the algorithm allows it to be used in either a real-time trigger mode, or a retrospective mode. Maximum likelihood or marginal posterior functions to measure model fitness are presented for events, binned counts, and measurements at arbitrary times with known error distributions. Problems addressed include those connected with data gaps, variable exposure, extension to piecewise linear and piecewise exponential representations, multi-variate time series data, analysis of variance, data on the circle, other data modes, and dispersed data. Simulations provide evidence that the detection efficiency for weak signals is close to a theoretical asymptotic limit derived by (Arias-Castro, Donoho and Huo 2003). In the spirit of Reproducible Research (Donoho et al. 2008) all of the code and data necessary to reproduce all of the figures in this paper are included as auxiliary material.},

Several astrophysically meaningful examples are given, in particular photometric light curves of a bright spot located on the surface of an accretion disk and orbiting the black hole.

These influences can be described by a "transfer function," which one folds into any assumed spectrum emitted on the disk's surface to get the spectrum observed at various locations far from the disk. This paper formulates such a transfer function and tabulates it for Kerr black holes of aIM = 0 and 0.9981. The transfer function depends strongly on the polar angle of the observer: An observer near the plane of the disk sees radiation from its hot inner regions to be less redshifted and to subtend a greater solid angle than does an observer near the disk's polar axis. Consequently, the equatorial observer sees a much harder spectrum at high energies than does the polar observer. This effect is more pronounced for black holes of larger angular momentum.

	abstract = {We present a new picture for the central regions of Black Hole X-ray Binaries. In our view, these central regions have a multi-flow configuration which consists in (1) an outer standard accretion disc down to a transition radius r\_J, (2) an inner magnetized accretion disc below r\_J driving (3) a non relativistic self-collimated electron-proton jet surrounding, when adequate conditions for pair creation are met, (4) a ultra relativistic electron-positron beam. This accretion-ejection paradigm provides a simple explanation to the canonical spectral states by varying the transition radius r\_J and disc accretion rate independently. Large values of r\_J correspond to the Quiescent state for low \${\textbackslash}dot m\$ and the Hard state for larger \${\textbackslash}dot m\$. These states are characterized by the presence of a steady electron-proton MHD jet emitted by the disc below r\_J. The hard X-ray component is expected to form at the jet basis. When r\_j becomes smaller than the marginally stable orbit r\_i, the whole disc resembles a standard accretion disc, characteristic of the Soft state. Intermediate states correspond to situations where r\_J {\textasciitilde} r\_i. At large \${\textbackslash}dot m\$, an unsteady pair cascade process is triggered within the jet axis, giving birth to ejection of relativistic pair blobs. This would correspond to the luminous intermediate state, with its associated superluminal motions. The variation of r\_J independently of \${\textbackslash}dot m\$ is a necessary ingredient in this picture, arising from the presence of a large scale vertical magnetic field threading the disc.},

	abstract = {The spectral evolution of transient X-ray binaries can be reproduced by an interplay between two flows separated at a radius \$R\_J\$: a standard accretion disk (SAD) in the outer parts and a jet-emitting disk (JED) in the inner parts. In the previous papers of this series, we recover the spectral evolution in both X-rays and radio for four outbursts of GX339-4 by playing independently with the two parameters: \$R\_J\$ and the accretion rate \${\textbackslash}dot\{M\}\_\{in\}\$. In this paper, we compare the time evolution of \$R\_J\$ and \${\textbackslash}dot\{M\}\_\{in\}\$ for the four outbursts. We show that despite the undeniable differences between the time evolution of each outburst, a unique pattern in the \${\textbackslash}dot\{M\}\_\{in\}-R\_J\$ plane seems to be followed by all cycles within the JED-SAD model. We call this pattern a fingerprint, and show that even the 'failed' outburst considered follows it. We also compute the radiative efficiency in X-rays during the cycles and consider its impact on the radio--X-ray correlation. Within the JED-SAD paradigm, we find that the accretion flow is always radiatively efficient in the hard states, with between \$15{\textbackslash}\%\$ and \$40{\textbackslash}\%\$ of the accretion power being radiated away at any given time. Moreover, we show that the radiative efficiency evolves with the accretion rate because of key changes in the JED thermal structure. These changes give birth to two different regimes with different radiative efficiencies: the thick disk and the slim disk. While the existence of these two regimes is intrinsically linked to the JED-SAD model, we show direct observational evidence of the presence of two different regimes using the evolution of the X-ray power-law spectral index, a model-independent estimate. We then argue that these two regimes could be the origin of the gap in X-ray luminosity in the hard state, the wiggles and different slopes seen in the radio--X-ray correlation, and even the existence of outliers.},

	abstract = {Recently, Neural Ordinary Differential Equations has emerged as a powerful framework for modeling physical simulations without explicitly defining the ODEs governing the system, but instead learning them via machine learning. However, the question: "Can Bayesian learning frameworks be integrated with Neural ODE's to robustly quantify the uncertainty in the weights of a Neural ODE?" remains unanswered. In an effort to address this question, we primarily evaluate the following categories of inference methods: (a) The No-U-Turn MCMC sampler (NUTS), (b) Stochastic Gradient Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (SGHMC) and (c) Stochastic Langevin Gradient Descent (SGLD). We demonstrate the successful integration of Neural ODEs with the above Bayesian inference frameworks on classical physical systems, as well as on standard machine learning datasets like MNIST, using GPU acceleration. On the MNIST dataset, we achieve a posterior sample accuracy of 98.5\% on the test ensemble of 10,000 images. Subsequently, for the first time, we demonstrate the successful integration of variational inference with normalizing flows and Neural ODEs, leading to a powerful Bayesian Neural ODE object. Finally, considering a predator-prey model and an epidemiological system, we demonstrate the probabilistic identification of model specification in partially-described dynamical systems using universal ordinary differential equations. Together, this gives a scientific machine learning tool for probabilistic estimation of epistemic uncertainties.},

We consider separately the cases of point-like and extended central sources. Based on the first three moments of the line energy distribution (i.e. the line intensity, centroid energy and width) and the two-dimensional transfer function, we identify a number of characteristic features, which can help in assessing the presence of a relativistic accretion disc and in estimating its parameters. In particular, by combining an absolute time measurement of the maximum of the line response function with a relative measurement in units of light crossing time, the mass of the central object can be derived.},

Here, we develop machine learning (ML) models to extract the X-ray reverberation features imprinted in the power spectral density (PSD) of active galactic nucleus (AGN). The machine is trained using simulated PSDs in the form of a simple power-law encoded with the relativistic echo features. Dictionary learning and sparse coding algorithms are used for the PSD reconstruction, by transforming the noisy PSD to a representative sparse version. Then, the support vector machine is employed to extract the interpretable reverberation features from the reconstructed PSD that holds the information of the source height. The results show that the accuracy of predicting the source height, h, is genuinely high and the misclassiﬁcation is only found when h {\textgreater} 15rg. When the test PSD has a bending power-law shape, which is completely new to the machine, the accuracy is still high. Therefore, the ML model does not require the intrinsic shape of the PSD to be determined in advance. By focusing on the PSD parameter space observed in real AGN data, classiﬁcation for h ≤ 10rg can be determined with 100 per cent accuracy, even using a PSD in an energy band that contains a reﬂection ﬂux as low as 10 per cent of the total ﬂux. For h {\textgreater} 10rg, the data, if misclassiﬁed, will have small uncertainties of h ∼ 2–4rg. This work shows, as a proof of concept, that the ML technique could shape new methodological directions in the X-ray reverberation analysis.},

	abstract = {Variations in the strengths of the central photoionizing source in a quasar or Seyfert galaxy will generate variations in the strengths and profiles of the emission Unes. These “reverberations” in the emission Unes will lag behind the continuum variations due to Ught travel time effects. A procedure is described for analyzing a time series of measurements of both the continuum and the Unes. This procedure permits direct verification of the assumed causal connection of the Unes to the continuum. We demonstrate that if the emission Une region has a high degree of symmetry, then it is possible to invert the time-dependent Une profiles and obtain the phase space distribution of the emission-Une gas—i.e., its emissivity and the moments of its velocity distribution as functions of position. The cases of spherical and disk symmetry are considered in detail; the case of a straight jet, which may be relevant to correlated optical and radio variations, is discussed briefly. Explicit calculations of expected line variations have been carried out for several simple models. We suggest that with recently developed instrumentation it should now be possible to apply this technique to Seyfert galaxies. Long term, highly accurate observations will be required for the appUcation to quasars.},

In principle, future high-throughput X-ray spectrometers should be able to examine the temporal response of this fluorescent line to flares in the X-ray continuum source (which energizes this emission line)—i.e., iron line reverberation mapping will be possible. It has been previously found that there are robust reverberation signatures of the black hole spin, mass, and the X-ray flare location above the accretion disk. Here, we simulate observations of a bright Seyfert nucleus with the proposed NASA mission Constellation-X and demonstrate the feasibility of detecting these reverberation signatures with this mission. Hence, starting with XMM in 1999 and maturing with Constellation-X in ca. 2010, iron line reverberation will open a new window on the innermost regions of AGNs.},

	abstract = {The spin of a black hole is an important quantity to study, providing a window into the processes by which a black hole was born and grew. Further, spin can be a potent energy source for powering relativistic jets and energetic particle acceleration. In this review, I describe the techniques currently used to detect and measure the spins of black holes. It is shown that: (1) Two well understood techniques, X-ray reflection spectroscopy and thermal continuum fitting, can be used to measure the spins of black holes that are accreting at moderate rates. There is a rich set of other electromagnetic techniques allowing us to extend spin measurements to lower accretion rates. (2) Many accreting supermassive black holes are found to be rapidly-spinning, although a population of more slowly spinning black holes emerges at masses above \$M{\textgreater}3{\textbackslash}times 10{\textasciicircum}7{\textbackslash},M\_{\textbackslash}odot\$ as expected from recent structure formation models. (3) Many accreting stellar-mass black holes in X-ray binary systems are rapidly spinning and must have been born in this state. (4) The advent of gravitational wave astronomy has enabled the detection of spin effects in merging binary black holes. Most of the pre-merger black holes are found to be slowly spinning, a notable exception being an object that may itself be a merger product. (5) The stark difference in spins between the black hole X-ray binary and the binary black hole populations shows that there is a diversity of formation mechanisms. Given the array of new electromagnetic and gravitational wave
capabilities currently being planned, the future of black hole spin studies is bright.},

	abstract = {The relativistically broad X-ray iron line seen in many active galactic nucleus (AGN) spectra is thought to originate from the central regions of the putative black hole accretion disk. Both the line profile and strength will vary in response to rapid variability of the primary X-ray continuum source. The temporal response of the line contains information on the accretion disk structure, the X-ray source geometry, and the spin of the black hole. Since the X-ray source will have a size comparable with the fluorescing region of the accretion disk, the general
reverberation problem is not invertible. However, progress can be made, since, empirically, AGN light curves are seen to undergo dramatic short timescale variability that presumably corresponds to the creation of a single new active region within the distributed X-ray source. The iron-line response to these individual events can be described using linear transfer theory. We consider the line response to the
activation/flaring of a new X-ray emitting region. Most of our detailed calculations are performed for the case of an X-ray source on the symmetry axis and at some height above the disk plane around a Kerr black hole. We also present preliminary calculations for off-axis flares. We suggest ways in which future, high-throughput X-ray
observatories such as XMM and the Constellation X-ray Mission may use these reverberation signatures to probe both the mass and spin of AGN black holes as well as the X-ray source geometry.},

	abstract = {We present an extended corona model based on ray-tracing simulations to investigate X-ray time lags in active galactic nuclei (AGNs). This model consists of two axial point sources illuminating an accretion disc that produce the reverberation lags. These lags are due to the time delays between the directly observed and reflection photons and are associated with the light-travel time between the source and the disc, so they allow us to probe the disc-corona geometry. We assume the variations of two X-ray sources are triggered by the same primary variations, but allow the two sources to respond in different ways (I.e. having
different source responses). The variations of each source induce a delayed accretion disc response and the total lags consist of a
combination of both source and disc responses. We show that the extended corona model can reproduce both the low-frequency hard and
high-frequency soft (reverberation) lags. Fitting the model to the timing data of PG 1244+026 reveals the hard and soft X-ray sources at ∼6rg and ∼11rg, respectively. The upper
source produces small amounts of reflection and can be interpreted as a relativistic jet, or outflowing blob, whose emission is beamed away from the disc. This explains the observed lag energy in which there is no soft lag at energies {\textless}1 keV as they are diluted by the soft continuum of the upper source. Finally, our models suggest that the fluctuations propagating between the two sources of PG 1244+026 are possible but only at near the speed of light.},

and variable iron line seen in the high flux state of Mrk 335. The model
consists of a variable X-ray source positioned along the rotation axis
of the black hole that illuminates the accretion disc producing a
back-scattered, ionized reflection spectrum. We compute time lags
including full-dilution effects and perform simultaneous fitting of the
2-10 keV spectrum and the frequency-dependent time lags of 2.5-4 versus
4-6.5 keV bands. The best-fitting parameters are consistent with a black
hole mass of ≈1.3 × 107 M⊙, disc
inclination of 45° and the photon index of the direct continuum of
2.4. The iron abundance is 0.5 and the ionization parameter is
103 erg cm s-1 at the innermost part of the disc
and decreases further out. The X-ray source height is very small,
≈2rg. Furthermore, we fit the Fe-L lags simultaneously
with the 0.3-10 keV spectrum. The key parameters are comparable to those
previously obtained. We also report the differences below 2 keV using
the XILLVER and REFLIONX models, which could affect the interpretation
of the soft excess. While simultaneously fitting spectroscopic and
timing data can break the degeneracy between the source height and the
black hole mass, we find that the measurements of the source height and
the central mass significantly depend on the ionization state of the
disc and are possibly model dependent.},

We extend the method to non-Hamiltonian problems as well, and investigate optimal methods of projecting the extended phase space back to original dimension. Finally, we apply the methods to a Hamiltonian problem of geodesics in a curved space, and a non-Hamiltonian problem of a forced non-linear oscillator. We compare the performance of the methods to a general purpose differential equation solver LSODE, and the implicit midpoint method, a symplectic one-step method. We find the extended phase space methods to compare favorably to both for the Hamiltonian problem, and to the implicit midpoint method in the case of the non-linear oscillator.},

We also analyze the classical Burrau three-body problem using full numerical evolutions. In both cases, we find behaviors distinctly different from Newtonian predictions, which has important implications for N-body black-hole simulations. For our simulations we use analytic approximate data. We find that the eighth-order stencils significantly reduce the numerical errors for our choice of grid sizes, and that the approximate initial data produces the expected waveforms (after a rescaling of the puncture masses) for black-hole binaries with modest initial separations.},

Using our most recent conformal thin-sandwich BHNS initial data and our fully general relativistic hydrodynamics code, which is now AMR-capable, we are able to efficiently and accurately simulate these binaries from large separations through inspiral, merger, and ringdown. We evolve the metric using the BSSN formulation with the standard moving puncture gauge conditions and handle the hydrodynamics with a high-resolution shock-capturing scheme. We explore the effects of BH spin (aligned and anti-aligned with the orbital angular momentum) by evolving three sets of initial data with BH:NS mass ratio q=3: the data sets are nearly identical, except the BH spin is varied between a/M = -0.5 (anti-aligned), 0.0, and 0.75. The number of orbits before merger increases with a/M, as expected. We also study the nonspinning BH case in more detail, varying q between 1, 3, and 5. We calculate gravitational waveforms for the cases we simulate and compare them to binary black-hole waveforms. Only a small disk ({\textless} 0.01 M\_sun) forms for the anti-aligned spin case (a/M = -0.5) and for the most extreme mass ratio case (q=5). By contrast, a massive (M\_disk is about 0.2 M\_sun), hot disk forms in the rapidly spinning (a/M = 0.75) aligned BH case. Such a disk could drive a SGRB,possibly by, e.g., producing a copious flux of neutrino-antineutino pairs.},

	abstract = {We present results from a numerical study of critical gravitational collapse of axisymmetric distributions of massless scalar field energy. We find threshold behavior that can be described by the spherically symmetric critical solution with axisymmetric perturbations. However, we see indications of a growing, non-spherical mode about the spherically symmetric critical solution. The effect of this instability is that the small asymmetry present in what would otherwise be a spherically symmetric self-similar solution grows. This growth continues until a bifurcation occurs and two distinct regions form on the axis, each resembling the spherically symmetric self-similar solution. The existence of a non-spherical unstable mode is in conflict with previous perturbative results, and we therefore discuss whether such a mode exists in the continuum limit, or whether we are instead seeing a marginally stable mode that is rendered unstable by numerical approximation.},

We apply this code to a series of test cases including a robust stability test, a nonlinear gauge wave and an excised Schwarzschild black hole in an evolving gauge. We find that the mesh refinement results are comparable in accuracy, stability and convergence to unigrid simulations with the same effective resolution. At the same time, the use of FMR reduces the computational resources needed to obtain a given accuracy. Particular care must be taken at the interfaces between coarse and fine grids to avoid a loss of convergence at higher resolutions, and we introduce the use of "buffer zones" as one resolution of this issue. We also introduce a new method for initial data generation, which enables higher-order interpolation in time even from the initial time slice. This FMR system, "Carpet", is a driver module in the freely available Cactus computational infrastructure, and is able to endow generic existing Cactus simulation modules ("thorns") with FMR with little or no extra effort.},

	abstract = {We consider the motion of classical spinning test particles in Schwarzschild and Kerr metrics and investigate innermost stable circular orbits (ISCO). The main goal of this work is to find analytically the small-spin corrections for the parameters of ISCO (radius, total angular momentum, energy, orbital angular frequency) of spinning test particles in the case of vectors of black hole spin, particle spin and orbital angular momentum being collinear to each other. We analytically derive the small-spin linear corrections for arbitrary Kerr parameter \$a\$. The cases of Schwarzschild, slowly rotating and extreme Kerr black hole are considered in details. For a slowly rotating black hole the ISCO parameters are obtained up to quadratic in \$a\$ and particle's spin \$s\$ terms. From the formulae obtained it is seen that the spin-orbital coupling has attractive character when spin and angular momentum are parallel and repulsive when they are antiparallel. For the case of the extreme Kerr black hole with co-rotating particle we succeed to find the exact analytical solution for the limiting ISCO parameters for arbitrary spin. It has been shown that the limiting values of ISCO radius and frequency do not depend on the particle's spin while values of energy and total angular momentum depend on it. We have also considered circular orbits of arbitrary radius and have found small-spin linear corrections for the total angular momentum and energy at given radius. System of equations for numerical calculation of ISCO parameters for arbitrary \$a\$ and \$s\$ is also explicitly written.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.02781},
	abstract = {The inner boundary of a black hole accretion disk is often set to the marginally stable circular orbit (or the innermost stable circular orbit, ISCO) around the black hole. It is important for the theories of black hole accretion disks and their applications to astrophysical black hole systems. Traditionally, the marginally stable circular orbit is obtained by considering the equatorial motion of a test particle around a black hole. However, in reality the accretion flow around black holes consists of fluid, in which the pressure often plays an important role. Here we consider the influence of fluid pressure on the location of marginally stable circular orbit around black holes. It is found that when the temperature of the fluid is so low that the thermal energy of a particle is much smaller than its rest energy, the location of marginally stable circular orbit is almost the same as that in the test particle case. However, we demonstrate that in some special cases the marginally stable circular orbit can be different when the fluid pressure is large and the thermal energy becomes non-negligible comparing with the rest energy. We present our results for both the cases of non-spinning and spinning black holes. The influences of our results on the black hole spin parameter measurement in X-ray binaries and the energy release efficiency of accretion flows around black holes are discussed.},

In particular, we determine analytically, to ﬁrst order in the dimensionless ring-to-black-hole mass ratio m/Mir, the shift ∆Ωmb/Ωmb in the orbital frequency of the marginally bound circular geodesic that characterizes the composed curved spacetime. Interestingly, our analytical results for the frequency shift ∆Ωmb in the composed black-hole-orbiting-ring toy model agree qualitatively with the recently published numerical results for the corresponding frequency shift in the physically related (and mathematically much more complex) black-hole-orbiting-particle system. In particular, the present analysis provides evidence that, at order O(m/Mir), the recently observed positive shift in the angular frequency of the marginally bound circular orbit is directly related to the physically intriguing phenomenon of dragging of inertial frames by orbiting masses in general relativity.},

	abstract = {One of the most important geodesics in a black-hole spacetime is the marginally bound spherical orbit. This critical geodesic represents the innermost spherical orbit which is bound to the central black hole. The radii rmb(a¯) of the marginally bound equatorial circular geodesics of rotating Kerr black holes were found analytically by Bardeen et. al. more than four decades ago (here a¯ ≡ J/M 2 is the dimensionless angular-momentum of the black hole). On the other hand, no closed-form formula exists in the literature for the radii of generic (non-equatorial) marginally bound geodesics of the rotating Kerr spacetime. In the present study we analyze the critical (marginally bound) orbits of rapidly rotating Kerr black holes. In particular, we derive a simple analytical formula for the radii rmb(a¯ ≃ 1; cos i) of the marginally bound spherical orbits, where cos i is an eﬀective inclination angle (with respect to the black-hole equatorial plane) of the geodesic. We ﬁnd that the marginally bound spherical orbits of rapidly-rotating black holes are characterized by a critical inclination angle, cos i = 2/3, above which the coordinate radii of the geodesics approach the black-hole radius in the extremal a¯ → 1 limit. It is shown that this critical inclination angle signals a transition in the physical properties of the orbits: in particular, it separates marginally bound spherical geodesics which lie a ﬁnite proper distance from the black-hole horizon from marginally bound geodesics which lie an inﬁnite proper distance from the horizon.},

For selected equations of state we numerically solve the full Einstein equations to determine the neutron star space–time along constant rest mass sequences. The analytic solution is then matched to the numerical solutions by imposing the condition that the quadrupole moment of the numerical and analytic space–times be the same. For the analytic solution we consider, such a matching condition can be satisﬁed only for very rapidly rotating stars. When solutions to the matching condition exist, they belong to one of two branches. For one branch the current octupole moment of the analytic solution is very close to the current octupole moment of the numerical space–time; the other branch is more similar to the Kerr solution. We present an extensive comparison of the radii of innermost stable circular orbits (ISCOs) obtained with (i) the analytic solution, (ii) the Kerr metric, (iii) an analytic series expansion derived by Shibata and Sasaki and (iv) a highly accurate numerical code. In most cases where a co-rotating ISCO exists, the analytic solution has an accuracy consistently better than the Shibata–Sasaki expansion. The numerical code is used for tabulating the mass quadrupole and current octupole moments for several sequences of constant rest mass.},

	abstract = {According to the no-hair theorem, astrophysical black holes are uniquely characterized by their masses and spins and are described by the Kerr metric. Several parametric deviations from the Kerr metric have been suggested to study observational signatures in both the electromagnetic and gravitational-wave spectra that differ from the expected Kerr signals. Due to the no-hair theorem, however, such spacetimes cannot be regular everywhere outside the event horizons, if they are solutions to the Einstein field equations; they are often characterized by naked singularities or closed time-like loops in the regions of the spacetime that are accessible to an external observer. For observational tests of the no-hair theorem that involve phenomena in the vicinity of the circular photon orbit or the innermost stable circular orbit around a black hole, these pathologies limit the applicability of the metrics only to compact objects that do not spin rapidly. In this paper, we construct a Kerr-like metric which depends on a set of free parameters in addition to its mass and spin and which is regular everywhere outside of the event horizon. We derive expressions for the energy and angular momentum of a particle on a circular equatorial orbit around the black hole and compute the locations of the innermost stable circular orbit and the circular photon orbit. We demonstrate that these orbits change significantly for even moderate deviations from the Kerr metric. The properties of our metric make it an ideally suited spacetime to carry out strong-field tests of the no-hair theorem in the electromagnetic spectrum using the properties of accretion flows around astrophysical black holes of arbitrary spin.},

	abstract = {We study the properties of a low-angular momentum, inviscid, advective accretion ﬂow in a deformed Kerr spacetime under the framework of general theory of relativity. We solve the governing equations that describe the ﬂow motion in terms of input parameters, namely energy (E), angular momentum (λ), spin (ak) and deformation parameter (ε), respectively. We ﬁnd that global transonic accretion solutions continue to exist in non-Kerr spacetime. Depending on the input parameters, accretion ﬂow is seen to experience shock transition and we ﬁnd that shocked induced accretion solutions are available for a wide range of the parameter space in λ − E plane. We examine the modiﬁcation of the shock parameter space with ε, and ﬁnd that as ε is increased, the eﬀective region of the parameter space is reduced, and gradually shifted towards the higher λ and lower E domain. In addition, for the ﬁrst time in the literature, we notice that accretion ﬂow having zero angular momentum admits shock transition when spacetime deformation is signiﬁcantly large. Interestingly, beyond a critical limit of εmax, the nature of the central object alters from black hole to naked singularity and we identify εmax as function of ak. Further, we examine the accretion solutions and its properties around the naked singularity as well. Finally, we indicate the implications of the present formalism in the context of astrophysical applications.},

Observations of the X-ray polarization signal from active galactic nuclei (AGNs) or X-ray binary systems (XRBs) will bring new means to study inner accretion ﬂow in these objects that, together with currently used spectroscopic and timing techniques, will help us to determine better their properties, such as their inclination, orientation, shape, and size of their corona as well as the black hole spin. In this work, we present a yet missing piece in the global polarization models of black hole accretion discs. We compute the reﬂected X-ray emission from the disc in a local co-moving frame using (1) the radiative transfer code TITAN to obtain the ionization structure of the disc and (2) the Monte Carlo code STOKES that incorporates the physics of absorption, re-emission, and Compton scattering to produce a complete spectropolarimetric output. We present the ﬁnal Stokes parameters 𝐼, 𝑄 and 𝑈 for a set of photon-indices of the incident primary power-law radiation, the disc ionization parameters, incident and emission angles, for three independent polarization states of the incident coronal X-ray photons with a suﬃcient resolution in energy to allow for sharp discussion of spectral and polarization properties. We show that the spectral component matches well literature predictions. The polarization degree and angle are in agreement with analytical approximations previously appearing in reﬂection models and we demonstrate that the polarized reﬂected X-ray emission can be, locally, quite large in the 2–12 keV band.},

	abstract = {It is generally thought that the light coming from the inner plunging region of black hole accretion discs contributes negligibly to the disc’s overall spectrum, i.e. the plunging ﬂuid is swallowed by the black hole before it has time to radiate. In the standard disc model used to ﬁt X-ray observations of accretion discs, the plunging region is assumed to be perfectly dark. However, numerical simulations that include the full physics of the magnetized ﬂow predict that a small fraction of the disc’s total luminosity emanates from the plunging region. We investigate the observational consequences of this neglected inner light. We compute radiativetransfer-based disc spectra that correspond to 3D general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic simulated discs (which produce light inside their plunging regions). In the context of black hole spin estimation, we ﬁnd that the neglected inner light only has a modest effect (this bias is less than typical observational systematic errors). For rapidly spinning black holes, we ﬁnd that the combined emission from the plunging region produces a weak power-law tail at high energies. This indicates that infalling matter is the origin for some of the ‘coronal’ emission observed in the thermal dominant and steep power-law states of X-ray binaries.},

	abstract = {Models of X-ray reverberation from extended coronæ are developed from general relativistic ray tracing simulations. Reverberation lags between correlated variability in the directly observed continuum emission and that reﬂected from the accretion disc arise due to the additional light travel time between the corona and reﬂecting disc. X-ray reverberation is detected from an increasing sample of Seyfert galaxies and a number of common properties are observed, including a transition from the characteristic reverberation signature at high frequencies to a hard lag within the continuum component at low frequencies, as well a pronounced dip in the reverberation lag at 3 keV. These features are not trivially explained by the reverberation of X-rays originating from simple point sources. We therefore model reverberation from coronæ extended both over the surface of the disc and vertically. Causal propagation through its extent for both the simple case of constant velocity propagation and propagation linked to the viscous timescale in the underlying accretion disc is included as well as stochastic variability arising due to turbulence locally on the disc. We ﬁnd that the observed features of X-ray reverberation in Seyfert galaxies can be explained if the long timescale variability is dominated by the viscous propagation of ﬂuctuations through the corona. The corona extends radially at low height over the surface of the disc but with a bright central region in which ﬂuctuations propagate up the black hole rotation axis driven by more rapid variability arising from the innermost regions of the accretion ﬂow.},

	abstract = {The widely used Novikov–Thorne relativistic thin disc equations are only valid down to the radius of the innermost stable circular orbit (ISCO). This leads to an undetermined boundary condition at the ISCO, known as the inner stress of the disc, which sets the luminosity of the disc at the ISCO and introduces considerable ambiguity in accurately determining the mass, spin, and accretion rate of black holes from observed spectra. We resolve this ambiguity by self-consistently extending the relativistic disc solution through the ISCO to the black hole horizon by calculating the inspiral of an average disc particle subject to turbulent disc forces, using a new particle-in-disc technique. Traditionally it has been assumed that the stress at the ISCO is zero, with material plunging approximately radially into the black hole at close to the speed of light. We demonstrate that in fact the inspiral is less severe, with several (∼4–17) orbits completed before the horizon. This leads to a small non-zero stress and luminosity at and inside the ISCO, with a local surface temperature at the ISCO between ∼0.15 and 0.3 times the maximum surface temperature of the disc, in the case where no dynamically important net magnetic ﬁeld is present. For a range of disc parameters we calculate the value of the inner stress/surface temperature, which is required when ﬁtting relativistic thin disc models to observations. We resolve a problem in relativistic slim disc models in which turbulent heating becomes inaccurate and falls to zero inside the plunging region.},

We solve for the time evolution of such a TDE disc, using an evolutionary equation valid for both the Newtonian and Kerr regimes. The late-time luminosity emergent from such a disc is of interest as a model diagnostic, as it tends to follow a power law decline. The original simple ballistic fallback model, with equal mass in equal energy intervals, produces a −5/3 power law, while standard viscous disc descriptions yield a somewhat more shallow decline, with an index closer to −1.2. Of four recent, well-observed TDE candidates however, all had fall-off power-law indices smaller than one in magnitude. In this work, we revisit the problem of thin disc evolution, solving this reduced problem in full general relativity. Our solutions produce power-law indices that are in much better accord with observations. The late-time observational data from many TDEs are generally supportive, not only of disc accretion models, but of ﬁnite stress persisting down to the innermost stable circular orbit.},

This theorem can be tested observationally by measuring (at least) three different multipole moments of the spacetimes of black holes. In this paper, we analyze images of black holes within a framework that allows us to calculate observables in the electromagnetic spectrum as a function of the mass, spin, and, independently, the quadrupole moment of a black hole. We show that a deviation of the quadrupole moment from the expected Kerr value leads to images of black holes that are either prolate or oblate depending on the sign and magnitude of the deviation. In addition, there is a ring-like structure around the black hole shadow with a diameter of ∼10 black hole masses that is substantially brighter than the image of the underlying accretion flow and that is independent of the astrophysical details of accretion flow models. We show that the shape of this ring depends directly on the mass, spin, and quadrupole moment of the black hole and can be used for an independent measurement of all three parameters. In particular, we demonstrate that this ring is highly circular for a Kerr black hole with a spin a ≲ 0.9 M, independent of the observer's inclination, but becomes elliptical and asymmetric if the no-hair theorem is violated. Near-future very long baseline interferometric observations of Sgr A* will image this ring and may allow for an observational test of the no-hair theorem.},

Throughout this section, we deal with the dualisms of low-powered radio sources versus high-powered radio galaxies and quasars and of synchrotron models versus inverse Compton models; and the distinction between the relativistic plasma responsible for the received radiation and the medium responsible for the transport of energy down the jet. The second section collects the observational and inferred parameters for the currently detected X-ray jets and attempts to put their relative sizes and luminosities in perspective. In the third section we ﬁrst give the relevant radio and optical jet characteristics, and then examine the details of the X-ray data and how they can be related to various jet attributes.

Since spectra are grouped by similarity, the distribution of spectra onto the map for a single galaxy, i.e., its "fingerprint", reveals the presence of distinct stellar populations within the galaxy indicating smoother or episodic star-formation histories. We further map the diversity of galaxy fingerprints onto a second map (DESOM-2). Using galaxy images and independent measures of galaxy morphology, we confirm that galaxies with similar fingerprints have similar morphologies and inclination angles. Since morphological information was not used in the mapping algorithm, relating galaxy morphology to the star-formation histories encoded in the fingerprints is one example of how the DESOM maps can be used to make scientific inferences.},

	abstract = {We formulate a spherical harmonically decomposed 1+1 scheme to self-consistently evolve the trajectory of a point particle and its gravitational metric perturbation to a Schwarzschild background spacetime. Following the work of Moncrief, we write down an action for perturbations in space-time geometry, combine that with the action for a point-particle, and then obtain Hamiltonian equations of motion for metric perturbations, the particle's coordinates, as well as their canonical momenta. Hamiltonian equations for the metric-perturbation and their conjugate momenta reduce to Zerilli-Moncrief and Regge-Wheeler master equations with source terms, which are gauge invariant, plus auxiliary equations that specify gauge. Hamiltonian equations for the particle, on the other hand, now include effect of metric perturbations - with these new terms derived from the same interaction Hamiltonian that had lead to those well-known source terms. In this way, space-time geometry and particle motion can be evolved in a self-consistent manner, in principle in any gauge. However, the point-particle nature of our source requires regularization, and we outline how the Detweiler-Whiting approach can be applied. In this approach, a singular field can be obtained using Hadamard decomposition of the Green's function and the regular field, which needs to be evolved numerically, is the result of subtracting the singular field from the total metric perturbation. In principle, any gauge that has the singular-regular field decomposition is suitable for our self-consistent scheme. In reality, however, this freedom is only possible if our singular field has a high enough level of smoothness. In the case of Lorenz gauge, for each l and m, we have 2 wave equations to evolve gauge invariant quantities and 8 first order differential equations to fix the gauge and determine the metric components.},

	abstract = {Abstract
            The 2019 novel coronavirus infectious disease (COVID-19) pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has created an unsustainable need for molecular diagnostic testing. Molecular approaches such as reverse transcription (RT) polymerase chain reaction (PCR) offers highly sensitive and specific means to detect SARS-CoV-2 RNA, however, despite it being the accepted “gold standard”, molecular platforms often require a tradeoff between speed versus throughput. Matrix assisted laser desorption ionization (MALDI)—time of flight (TOF)—mass spectrometry (MS) has been proposed as a potential solution for COVID-19 testing and finding a balance between analytical performance, speed, and throughput, without relying on impacted supply chains. Combined with machine learning (ML), this MALDI-TOF-MS approach could overcome logistical barriers encountered by current testing paradigms. We evaluated the analytical performance of an ML-enhanced MALDI-TOF-MS method for screening COVID-19. Residual nasal swab samples from adult volunteers were used for testing and compared against RT-PCR. Two optimized ML models were identified, exhibiting accuracy of 98.3\%, positive percent agreement (PPA) of 100\%, negative percent agreement (NPA) of 96\%, and accuracy of 96.6\%, PPA of 98.5\%, and NPA of 94\% respectively. Machine learning enhanced MALDI-TOF-MS for COVID-19 testing exhibited performance comparable to existing commercial SARS-CoV-2 tests.},

In this work, we propose to learn a single set of universal deep representations by distilling knowledge of multiple separately trained networks after co-aligning their features with the help of adapters and centered kernel alignment. We show that the universal representations can be further reﬁned for previously unseen domains by an efﬁcient adaptation step in a similar spirit to distance learning methods. We rigorously evaluate our model in the recent Meta-Dataset benchmark and demonstrate that it signiﬁcantly outperforms the previous methods while being more efﬁcient.

We analyzed the Twitter followers of more than 100 faculty members in ecology and evolutionary biology and found that their followers are, on average, predominantly (∼55\%) other scientists. However, beyond a threshold of ∼1000 followers, the range of follower types became more diverse and included research and educational organizations, media, members of the public with no stated association with science, and a small number of decision-makers. This varied audience was, in turn, followed by more people, resulting in an exponential increase in the social media reach of tweeting academic scientists. Tweeting, therefore, has the potential to disseminate scientific information widely after initial efforts to gain followers.

We established a machine-learning approach that trained on records from 51,831 tested individuals (of whom 4769 were confirmed to have COVID-19). The test set contained data from the subsequent week (47,401 tested individuals of whom 3624 were confirmed to have COVID-19). Our model predicted COVID-19 test results with high accuracy using only eight binary features: sex, age ≥60 years, known contact with an infected individual, and the appearance of five initial clinical symptoms. Overall, based on the nationwide data publicly reported by the Israeli Ministry of Health, we developed a model that detects COVID-19 cases by simple features accessed by asking basic questions. Our framework can be used, among other considerations, to prioritize testing for COVID-19 when testing resources are limited.},

            Deep learning methods for digital pathology analysis are an effective way to address multiple clinical questions, from diagnosis to prediction of treatment outcomes. These methods have also been used to predict gene mutations from pathology images, but no comprehensive evaluation of their potential for extracting molecular features from histology slides has yet been performed. We show that HE2RNA, a model based on the integration of multiple data modes, can be trained to systematically predict RNA-Seq profiles from whole-slide images alone, without expert annotation. Through its interpretable design, HE2RNA provides virtual spatialization of gene expression, as validated by CD3- and CD20-staining on an independent dataset. The transcriptomic representation learned by HE2RNA can also be transferred on other datasets, even of small size, to increase prediction performance for specific molecular phenotypes. We illustrate the use of this approach in clinical diagnosis purposes such as the identification of tumors with microsatellite instability.},

Recent developments and application of the technique to terrestrial volcanoes have demonstrated that a low-power, passive muon detector can peer deep into geological structures up to several kilometers in size, and provide crisp density proﬁle images of their interior at ten meter scale resolution. Preliminary estimates of muon production on Mars indicate that the near horizontal Martian muon ﬂux, which could be used for muon radiography, is as strong or stronger than that on Earth, making the technique suitable for exploration of numerous high priority geological targets on Mars. The high spatial resolution of muon radiography also makes the technique particularly suited for the discovery and delineation of Martian caverns, the most likely planetary environment for biological activity.},

Here we present DeepLIFT (Deep Learning Important FeaTures), a method for decomposing the output prediction of a neural network on a speciﬁc input by backpropagating the contributions of all neurons in the network to every feature of the input. DeepLIFT compares the activation of each neuron to its ‘reference activation’ and assigns contribution scores according to the difference. By optionally giving separate consideration to positive and negative contributions, DeepLIFT can also reveal dependencies which are missed by other approaches. Scores can be computed efﬁciently in a single backward pass. We apply DeepLIFT to models trained on MNIST and simulated genomic data, and show signiﬁcant advantages over gradient-based methods.

Emerging deep learning technology could serve as a powerful machine learning tool to predict quantitative phenotypes without imputation and also to discover potential associated genotype markers efficiently. We propose a deep-learning framework using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to predict the quantitative traits from SNPs and also to investigate genotype contributions to the trait using saliency maps. The missing values of SNPs are treated as a new genotype for the input of the deep learning model. We tested our framework on both simulation data and experimental datasets of soybean. The results show that the deep learning model can bypass the imputation of missing values and achieve more accurate results for predicting quantitative phenotypes than currently available other well-known statistical methods. It can also effectively and efficiently identify significant markers of SNPs and SNP combinations associated in genome-wide association study.},

	abstract = {Type II CRISPR immune systems in bacteria use a dual RNA-guided DNA endonuclease, Cas9, to cleave foreign DNA at specific sites. We show here that Cas9 assembles with hybrid guide RNAs in human cells and can induce the formation of double-strand DNA breaks (DSBs) at a site complementary to the guide RNA sequence in genomic DNA. This cleavage activity requires both Cas9 and the complementary binding of the guide RNA. Experiments using extracts from transfected cells show that RNA expression and/or assembly into Cas9 is the limiting factor for Cas9-mediated DNA cleavage. In addition, we find that extension of the RNA sequence at the 3′ end enhances DNA targeting activity in vivo. These results show that RNA-programmed genome editing is a facile strategy for introducing site-specific genetic changes in human cells.
          , 
            The ability to make specific changes to DNA—such as changing, inserting or deleting sequences that encode proteins—allows researchers to engineer cells, tissues and organisms for therapeutic and practical applications. Until now, such genome engineering has required the design and production of proteins with the ability to recognize a specific DNA sequence. The bacterial protein, Cas9, has the potential to enable a simpler approach to genome engineering because it is a DNA-cleaving enzyme that can be programmed with short RNA molecules to recognize specific DNA sequences, thus dispensing with the need to engineer a new protein for each new DNA target sequence.
            Now Jinek et al. demonstrate the capability of RNA-programmed Cas9 to introduce targeted double-strand breaks into human chromosomal DNA, thereby inducing site-specific genome editing reactions. Cas9 assembles with engineered single-guide RNAs in human cells and the resulting Cas9-RNA complex can induce the formation of double-strand breaks in genomic DNA at a site complementary to the guide RNA sequence. Experiments using extracts from transfected cells show that RNA expression and/or assembly into Cas9 is the limiting factor for the DNA cleavage, and that extension of the RNA sequence at the 3′ end enhances DNA targeting activity in vivo.
            These results show that RNA-programmed genome editing is a straightforward strategy for introducing site-specific genetic changes in human cells, and the ease with which it can programmed means that it is likely to become competitive with existing approaches based on zinc finger nucleases and transcription activator-like effector nucleases, and could lead to a new generation of experiments in the field of genome engineering for humans and other species with complex genomes.},

            Magnetic monopoles, proposed as elementary particles that act as isolated magnetic south and north poles, have long attracted research interest as magnetic analogs to electric charge. In solid-state physics, a classical analog to these elusive particles has emerged as topological excitations within pyrochlore spin ice systems. We present the first real-time imaging of emergent magnetic monopole motion in a macroscopically degenerate artificial spin ice system consisting of thermally activated Ising-type nanomagnets lithographically arranged onto a pre-etched silicon substrate. A real-space characterization of emergent magnetic monopoles within the framework of Debye-Hückel theory is performed, providing visual evidence that these topological defects act like a plasma of Coulomb-type magnetic charges. In contrast to vertex defects in a purely two-dimensional artificial square ice, magnetic monopoles are free to evolve within a divergence-free vacuum, a magnetic Coulomb phase, for which features in the form of pinch-point singularities in magnetic structure factors are observed.},

            Magnetic charge propagation in spin-ice materials has yielded a paradigm-shift in science, allowing the symmetry between electricity and magnetism to be studied. Recent work is now suggesting the spin-ice surface may be important in mediating the ordering and associated phase space in such materials. Here, we detail a 3D artificial spin-ice, which captures the exact geometry of bulk systems, allowing magnetic charge dynamics to be directly visualized upon the surface. Using magnetic force microscopy, we observe vastly different magnetic charge dynamics along two principal directions. For a field applied along the surface termination, local energetics force magnetic charges to nucleate over a larger characteristic distance, reducing their magnetic Coulomb interaction and producing uncorrelated monopoles. In contrast, applying a field transverse to the surface termination yields highly correlated monopole-antimonopole pairs. Detailed simulations suggest it is the difference in effective chemical potential as well as the energy landscape experienced during dynamics that yields the striking differences in monopole transport.},

	abstract = {We present Meena, a multi-turn open-domain chatbot trained end-to-end on data mined and ﬁltered from public domain social media conversations. This 2.6B parameter neural network is simply trained to minimize perplexity of the next token. We also propose a human evaluation metric called Sensibleness and Speciﬁcity Average (SSA), which captures key elements of a human-like multi-turn conversation. Our experiments show strong correlation between perplexity and SSA. The fact that the best perplexity end-to-end trained Meena scores high on SSA (72\% on multi-turn evaluation) suggests that a human-level SSA of 86\% is potentially within reach if we can better optimize perplexity. Additionally, the full version of Meena (with a ﬁltering mechanism and tuned decoding) scores 79\% SSA, 23\% higher in absolute SSA than the existing chatbots we evaluated.},

	abstract = {Recent studies demonstrate that machine learning algorithms can discriminate based on classes like race and gender. In this work, we present an approach to evaluate bias present in automated facial analysis algorithms and datasets with respect to phenotypic subgroups. Using the dermatologist approved Fitzpatrick Skin Type classiﬁcation system, we characterize the gender and skin type distribution of two facial analysis benchmarks, IJB-A and Adience. We ﬁnd that these datasets are overwhelmingly composed of lighter-skinned subjects (79.6\% for IJB-A and 86.2\% for Adience) and introduce a new facial analysis dataset which is balanced by gender and skin type. We evaluate 3 commercial gender classiﬁcation systems using our dataset and show that darker-skinned females are the most misclassiﬁed group (with error rates of up to 34.7\%). The maximum error rate for lighter-skinned males is 0.8\%. The substantial disparities in the accuracy of classifying darker females, lighter females, darker males, and lighter males in gender classiﬁcation systems require urgent attention if commercial companies are to build genuinely fair, transparent and accountable facial analysis algorithms.},

When compared with theoretical flux distribution from the surface of a thin disk surrounding a Kerr black hole, the observed X-ray properties of the Galactic superluminal jet sources, GRO J1655-40 and GRS 1915+105, strongly suggest that each contains a black hole spinning rapidly in the same direction as the accretion disk. We show, however, that some other black hole binaries with an ultrasoft X-ray component probably harbor only non- or slowly spinning black holes, and we argue that those with no detectable ultrasoft component above 1-2 keV in their high luminosity state may contain a fast-spinning black hole but with a retrograde disk. Therefore, all classes of known black hole binaries are united within one scheme. Furthermore, we explore the possibility that spectral state transitions in Cyg X-1 are simply due to temporary disk reversal, which can occur in a wind accretion system.},

Thermal reprocessing of the X-rays illuminating the accretion disk has been proposed as a viable explanation. In this scenario, the variable X-ray ﬂux irradiating the accretion disk is partially reﬂected in X-rays and partially absorbed, thermalized, and reemitted with some delay by the accretion disk at longer wavelengths. We investigate this scenario assuming an X-ray pointlike source illuminating a standard Novikov–Thorne accretion disk around a rotating black hole. We consider all special and general relativistic effects to determine the incident X-ray ﬂux on the disk and in propagating light from the source to the disk and to the observer. We also compute the disk reﬂection ﬂux, taking into consideration the disk ionization. We investigate the dependence of the disk response function and time lags on various physical parameters, such as the black hole mass and spin; X-ray corona height, luminosity, and photon index; accretion rate; inclination; and inner/outer disk radii. We ﬁnd it is important to consider relativistic effects and the disk ionization in estimating the disk response. We also ﬁnd a strong nonlinearity between the X-ray luminosity and the disk response. We present an analytic function for the time-lag dependence on wavelength, which can be used to ﬁt observed time-lag spectra. We also estimate the fraction of the reverberation signal with respect to the total ﬂux, and we suggest possible explanations for the lack of X-ray–UV/optical correlated variations in a few sources.},

In principle, this method can provide a powerful tool to measure the mass of super-massive black holes in active galactic nuclei. By comparing our simulations with the Chandra and XMM–Newton results, we show, however, that spectra from present generation X-ray satellites are not of good enough quality to exploit the method fully and determine the black hole mass with sufﬁcient accuracy.

	abstract = {Some of the X-ray temporal and spectral properties of accreting black holes represent a challenge for current theoretical models. In particular, uncorrelated variability between direct continuum and reﬂection components (including the iron line, if present) has been reported in many cases. Here, we explore a light bending model in which we assume a primary source of X-rays located close to a central, maximally rotating Kerr black hole and illuminating both the observer at inﬁnity and the accretion disc. We show that, due to strong light bending, the observed ﬂux can vary by more than one order of magnitude as the height of the primary source above the accretion disc varies, even if its intrinsic luminosity is constant. We identify three different regimes in which the reﬂection-dominated component (and the iron line) is correlated, anticorrelated or almost independent with respect to the direct continuum. These regimes correspond to low, high and intermediate ﬂux states of the X-ray source. As a general rule, the reﬂection component varies with much smaller amplitude than the continuum. X-ray observations of the Seyfert galaxy MCG–6-30-15 and of the Galactic black hole candidate XTE J1650–500 reveal that a series of predictions of our model is actually observed; the consistent behaviour of the iron line ﬂux and equivalent width with respect to the direct continuum, as well as the increase of the relative strength of disc reﬂection as the ﬂux drops, all match very well our predictions. The iron line proﬁle is predicted to be narrower in high ﬂux states and broader in (reﬂection-dominated) low ﬂux states, in fairly good agreement with observations of the best-studied case of MCG–6-30-15. Observations of some other narrow-line Seyfert 1 galaxies (e.g. NGC 4051) also seem to support our model, which may explain what are otherwise puzzling characteristics of some sources. We also show that beaming along the equatorial plane can enhance the re-emission of narrow reﬂection features from distant material during low ﬂux states providing a possible contribution to the observed X-ray Baldwin effect.},

In this framework, the activation of a new ﬂaring region in the hot corona imprints a time variation on the iron line spectrum. Future X-ray facilities with high time resolution and large eﬀective areas may be able to measure the so-called 2-dimensional transfer function; that is, the iron line proﬁle detected by a distant observer as a function of time in response to an instantaneous ﬂare from the X-ray primary source. This work is a preliminary study to determine if and how such a technique can provide more information about the spacetime geometry around the compact object than the already possible measurements of the time-integrated iron line proﬁle. Within our simpliﬁed model, we ﬁnd that a measurement of iron line reverberation can improve constraints appreciably given a suﬃciently strong signal, though that most of the information is present in the timeintegrated spectrum. Our aim is to test the Kerr metric. We ﬁnd that current X-ray facilities and data are unable to provide strong tests of the Kerr nature of supermassive black hole candidates. We consider an optimistic case of 105 iron line photons from a next-generation data set. With such data, the reverberation model improves upon the spectral constraint by an order of magnitude.},

	abstract = {According to the no-hair theorem, astrophysical black holes are uniquely described by their masses and spins. An observational test of the no-hair theorem can be performed by measuring at least three diﬀerent multipole moments of the spacetime of a black hole and verifying whether their values are consistent with the unique combinations of the Kerr solution. In this paper, we study quasi-periodic variability observed in the emission from black holes across the electromagnetic spectrum as a test of the no-hair theorem. We derive expressions for the Keplerian and epicyclic frequencies in a quasi-Kerr spacetime, in which the quadrupole moment is a free parameter in addition to mass and spin. We show that, for moderate spins, the Keplerian frequency is practically independent of small deviations of the quadrupole moment from the Kerr value, while the epicyclic frequencies exhibit signiﬁcant variations. We apply this framework to quasi-periodic oscillations in black-hole X-ray binaries in two diﬀerent scenarios. In the case that a pair of quasi-periodic oscillations can be identiﬁed as the fundamental g- and c-modes in the accretion disk, we show that the no-hair theorem can be tested in conjunction with an independent mass measurement. If pairs of oscillations are identiﬁed with non-parametric resonance of dynamical frequencies in the accretion disk, then testing the no-hair theorem also requires an independent measurement of the black-hole spin. In addition, we argue that VLBI observations of Sgr A* may test the no-hair theorem through a combination of imaging observations and the detection of quasi-periodic variability.},

	abstract = {In general relativity, all black holes in vacuum are described by the Kerr metric, which has only two independent parameters: the mass and the spin. The unique dependence on these two parameters is known as the “no-hair” theorem. This theorem may be tested observationally by using electromagnetic or gravitational-wave observations to map the spacetime around a candidate black hole and measure potential deviations from the Kerr metric. Several parametric frameworks have been constructed for tests of the no-hair theorem. Due to the uniqueness of the Kerr metric, any such parametric framework must violate at least one of the assumptions of the no-hair theorem. This can lead to pathologies in the spacetime, such as closed timelike curves or singularities, which may hamper using the metric in the strong-field regime. In this paper, I analyze in detail several parametric frameworks and show explicitly the manner in which they differ from the Kerr metric. I calculate the coordinate locations of event horizons in these metrics, if any exist, using methods adapted from the numerical relativity literature. I identify the regions where each parametric deviation is unphysical as well as the range of coordinates and parameters for which each spacetime remains a regular extension of the Kerr metric and is, therefore, suitable for observational tests of the no-hair theorem.},

In many current waveform models, e.g., the "Phenom" and "EOBNR" families that have been used extensively to analyse LIGO-Virgo GW observations, analytic approximations are used to add precession effects to models of non-precessing (aligned-spin) binaries, and it is only the aligned-spin models that are fully tuned to NR results. In PhenomPNR we incorporate precessing-binary NR results in two ways: (i) we produce the first NR-tuned model of the signal-based precession dynamics through merger and ringdown, and (ii) we extend a previous aligned-spin model, PhenomD, to include the effects of misaligned spins on the signal in the co-precessing frame. The NR calibration has been performed on 40 simulations of binaries with mass ratios between 1:1 and 1:8, where the larger black hole has a dimensionless spin magnitude of 0.4 or 0.8, and we choose five angles of spin misalignment with the orbital angular momentum. PhenomPNR has a typical mismatch accuracy within 0.1\% up to mass-ratio 1:4, and within 1\% up to mass-ratio 1:8.},

Periodic and quasi-periodic signals are indicators of fundamental time (and length) scales in the system, while stochastic processes help uncover the nature of turbulent accretion processes. A key method of studying time variability is through Fourier methods, the decomposition of the signal into sine waves, which yields a representation of the data in frequency space. With the extension into spectral timing the methods built on the Fourier transform can not only help us characterize (quasi-)periodicities and stochastic processes, but also uncover the complex relationships between time, photon energy and ﬂux in order to help build better models of accretion processes and other high-energy dynamical physics. In this Chapter, we provide a broad, but practical overview of the most important relevant methods.},

	abstract = {X-ray reverberation is a powerful technique that uses the echoes of the coronal emission reflected by a black hole (BH) accretion disk to map out the inner disk structure. While the theory of X-ray reverberation has been developed almost exclusively for standard thin disks, reverberation lags have recently been observed from likely super-Eddington accretion sources such as the jetted tidal disruption event Swift J1644+57. In this paper, we extend X-ray reverberation studies into the regime of super-Eddington accretion with a focus on investigating the lags in the fluorescent Fe Kα line region. We find that the coronal photons are mostly reflected by the fast and optically thick winds launched from the super-Eddington accretion flow, and this funnel-like reflection geometry produces lag-frequency and lag-energy spectra with unique observable characteristics. The lag-frequency spectrum exhibits a step-function-like decline near the first zero-crossing point. As a result, the magnitude of the lag scales linearly with the BH mass for a large parameter space, and the shape of the lag-energy spectrum remains almost independent of the choice of frequency bands. Not only can these features be used to distinguish super-Eddington accretion systems from sub-Eddington systems, but they are also key for constraining the reflection geometry and extracting parameters from the observed lags. When fitting the observed reverberation lag of Swift J1644+57 to our modeling, we find that the super-Eddington disk geometry is slightly preferred over the thin disk geometry, and we obtain a BH mass of 5-6 × 106 M ⊙ and a coronal height around 10 Rg .},

We present the results of reflection calculations that treat the relevant physics with a minimum of assumptions. The temperature and ionization structure of the top five Thomson depths of an illuminated disc are calculated while also demanding that the atmosphere is in hydrostatic equilibrium. In agreement with Nayakshin, Kazanas \&amp; Kallman, we find that there is a rapid transition from hot to cold material in the illuminated layer. However, the transition is usually not sharp, so that often we find a small but finite region in Thomson depth where there is a stable temperature zone at T ∼ 2 × 106 K due to photoelectric heating from recombining ions. As a result, the reflection spectra often exhibit strong features from partially ionized material, including helium-like Fe K lines and edges. The reflection spectra, when added to the illuminating spectra, were fitted by the publicly available constant-density models (i.e. pexriv, pexrav and the models of Ross \&amp; Fabian). We find that owing to the highly ionized features in the spectra these models have difficulty correctly parametrizing the new reflection spectra. There is evidence for a spurious R–Γ correlation in the ASCA energy range, where R is the reflection fraction for a power-law continuum of index Γ, confirming the suggestion of Done \&amp; Nayakshin that at least part of the R–Γ correlation reported by Zdziarski, Lubiński \&amp; Smith for Seyfert galaxies and X-ray binaries might be due to ionization effects. However, large uncertainties in the fit parameters prevent confirmation of the correlation in the 3–20 keV energy range. Although many of the reflection spectra show strong, ionized features, these are not typically observed in most Seyfert and quasar X-ray spectra. However, the data are not yet good enough to place constraints on the illumination properties of discs, as instrumental and/or relativistic effects could mask the ionized features predicted by the models.},

By combining with the reflection spectrum, warm coronae may be responsible for producing the smooth soft excess seen in AGN X-ray spectra. This paper studies how a warm corona must adjust in order to sustain the soft excess through large changes in the AGN flux. Spectra from one-dimensional constant density and hydrostatic warm corona models are calculated assuming that the illuminating hard X-ray power law, gas density, Thomson depth, and coronal heating strength vary in response to changes in the accretion rate. We identify models that produce warm coronae with temperatures between 0.3 and 1.1 keV, and measure the photon indices and emitted fluxes in the 0.5-2 and 2-10 keV bands. Correlations and anticorrelations between these quantities depend on the evolution and structure of the warm corona. Tracing the path that an AGN follows through these correlations will constrain how warm coronae are heated and connected to the accretion disc. Variations in the density structure and coronal heating strength of warm coronae will lead to a variety of soft excess strengths and shapes in AGNs. A larger accretion rate will, on average, lead to a warm corona that produces a stronger soft excess, consistent with observations of local Seyfert galaxies.},

In order to fit the observed data, the gas must be at temperatures of ∼1 keV and have an optical depth of τT ≈ 10-20. We present one-dimensional calculations of the physical conditions and emitted spectra of a τT = 10 or 20 gas layer subject to illumination from an X-ray power law (from above), a blackbody (from below), and a variable amount of internal heating. The models show that a warm corona with kT ∼ 1 keV can develop, producing a strong Comptonized soft excess, but only if the internal heating flux is within a relatively narrow range. Similarly, if the gas density of the layer is too large then efficient cooling will stop a warm corona from forming. The radiation from the hard X-ray power law is crucial in producing a warm corona, indicating that a warm and hot corona may coexist in AGN accretion discs, and their combined effect leads to the observed soft excess. Intense heating of a warm corona leads to steep X-ray spectra with ionized Fe K α lines, similar to those seen in some narrow-line Seyfert 1 galaxies.},

	abstract = {We present the ﬁrst X-ray reﬂection model for testing the assumption that the metric of astrophysical black holes is described by the Kerr solution. We employ the formalism of the transfer function proposed by Cunningham. The calculations of the reﬂection spectrum of a thin accretion disk are split into two parts: the calculation of the transfer function and the calculation of the local spectrum at any emission point in the disk. The transfer function only depends on the background metric and takes into account all the relativistic effects (gravitational redshift, Doppler boosting, and light bending). Our code computes the transfer function for a spacetime described by the Johannsen metric and can easily be extended to any stationary, axisymmetric, and asymptotically ﬂat spacetime. Transfer functions and single line shapes in the Kerr metric are compared tothose calculated from existing codes to check that we reach the necessary accuracy. We also simulate some observations with NuSTAR and LAD/eXTP and ﬁt the data with our new model to show the potential capabilities of current and future observations to constrain possible deviations from the Kerr metric.},

The formulation takes full account of relativistic eﬀects in the photon transport and the relative motions of the emitters and the light-of-sight absorbing material. We apply the formulation to calculate the emission from accretion disks and tori around rotating black holes. In our model the emission lines and continuum originate from an accretion disk or torus, and the motion of the emitters in the disk/torus is determined by the gravity of the black hole and the spacetime structure near the black hole. The line-of-sight absorbing medium is comprised of cold absorbing cloudlets. These cloudlets are kinematically hot, with their velocity dispersion determined by the local virial temperature. The emission from the accretion disk/torus is resonantly absorbed/scattered. Our calculations demonstrate that line-of-sight absorption signiﬁcantly modiﬁes the proﬁles of lines from the accretion disks. It is often diﬃcult to disentangle absorption eﬀects from other geometrical and kinematics eﬀects, such as the viewing inclination and the spin of the black hole. Our calculations also show that emission lines from accretion tori and from thin accretion disks diﬀer substantially. Large geometrical obscuration could occur in tori, and as a consequence lines from tori generally have much weaker redshift wings at large viewing inclination angles. Moreover, the blue peak is truncated.},

The evolution of these transient sources is complex. Nevertheless, there are behavior patterns common to all of them as we show in a comprehensive comparison of six selected systems. Central to this comparison are three X-ray states of accretion, which are reviewed and defined quantitatively. We discuss phenomena that arise in strong gravitational fields, including relativistically-broadened Fe lines, high-frequency quasi-periodic oscillations (100 450 Hz), and relativistic radio and X-ray jets. Such phenomena show us how a black hole interacts with its environment, thereby complementing the picture of black holes that gravitational wave detectors will provide. We sketch a scenario for the potential impact of timing/spectral studies of accreting black holes on physics and discuss a current frontier topic, namely, the measurement of black hole spin.},

In this paper, we calculate the proﬁles of ﬂuorescent iron lines emitted from the accretion ﬂows around black hole candidates within a framework that allows us to perform the calculation as a function of its mass and spin as well as of a free parameter that measures potential deviations from the Kerr metric. We show that such deviations lead to line proﬁles that are signiﬁcantly altered and may exhibit a modiﬁed ﬂux ratio of the two peaks in their characteristic double-peaked shape. We also show that the disk inclination can be measured independently of the spin and the deviation parameter at low to intermediate inclination angles, as in the case of Kerr black holes. We estimate the precision that near-future X-ray missions such as Astro-H and ATHENA+ are required to achieve in order to resolve deviations from the Kerr metric in iron line proﬁles and show that constraints on such deviations will be strongest for rapidly spinning black holes. More generally, we show that measuring the line proﬁle with a precision of ∼5\% at disk inclinations of 30◦ or 60◦ constrains the deviation parameter to order unity for values of the spin a 0.5M.},

In this work, we expand the study of X-ray reverberation to all Seyfert galaxies in the XMM–Newton archive above a nominal rms variability and exposure level (a total of 43 sources). Approximately 50 per cent of sources exhibit iron K reverberation, in that the broad iron K emission line responds to rapid variability in the continuum. We also find that on long time-scales, the hard band emission lags behind the soft band emission in 85 per cent of sources. This ‘low-frequency hard lag’ is likely associated with the coronal emission, and so this result suggests that most sources with X-ray variability show intrinsic variability from the nuclear region. We update the known iron K lag amplitude versus black hole mass relation, and find evidence that the height or extent of the coronal source (as inferred by the reverberation time delay) increases with mass accretion rate.},

Two models for the origin of this 'soft excess' are ionized relativistic reflection from the inner accretion disc and Comptonization of thermal emission in a warm corona. Here, we introduce REXCOR, a new AGN X-ray (0.3-100 keV) spectral fitting model that self-consistently combines the effects of both ionized relativistic reflection and the emission from a warm corona. In this model, the accretion energy liberated in the inner disc is distributed between a warm corona, a lamppost X-ray source, and the accretion disc. The emission and ionized reflection spectrum from the inner 400 rg of the disc is computed, incorporating the effects of relativistic light-bending and blurring. The resulting spectra predict a variety of soft excess shapes and sizes that depend on the fraction of energy dissipated in the warm corona and lamppost. We illustrate the use of REXCOR by fitting to the joint XMM-Newton and NuSTAR observations of the Seyfert 1 galaxies HE 1143-1820 and NGC 4593, and find that both objects require a warm corona contribution to the soft excess. Eight REXCOR table models, covering different values of accretion rate, lamppost height, and black hole spin, are publicly available through the XSPEC website. Systematic use of REXCOR will provide insight into the distribution of energy in AGN accretion flows.},

In order to test this theorem with observations in either the electromagnetic or gravitational-wave spectra, several Kerr-like spacetimes have been constructed which describe potential deviations from the Kerr spacetime in parametric form. For electromagnetic tests of the no-hair theorem, such metrics allow for the proper modeling of the accretion flows around candidate black holes and the radiation emitted from them. In many of these models, the location of the inner edge of the accretion disk is of special importance. This inner edge is often taken to coincide with the innermost stable circular orbit, which can serve as a direct probe of the spin and the deviation from the Kerr metric. In certain cases, however, an innermost stable circular orbit does not exist, and the inner edge of an accretion disk is instead determined by an instability against small perturbations in the direction vertical to the disk. In this paper, I analyze the properties of accretion disks in the Kerr-like metric proposed by Johannsen and Psaltis [Phys. Rev. D 83, 124015 (2011)], whose inner edges are located at the radii where this vertical instability occurs. I derive expressions of the energy and axial angular momentum of disk particles that move on circular equatorial orbits and calculate the locations of the inner disk edges. As a possible observable of such accretion disks, I simulate profiles of relativistically broadened iron lines and show that they depend significantly on the values of the spin and the deviation parameter.},

Three variations of the forecasting method are evaluated against PO data from two non-tracking, 1 MWp PV plants in California for 2011e2014. The method performance, including the inter-annual performance variability and the spatial smoothing of pairing the two plants, is evaluated in terms of standard error metrics, as well as in terms of the occurrence of severe forecasting error events. Results validate the performance of the proposed methodology as compared with previous studies. We also show that the bias errors in the irradiance inputs only have a limited impact on the PO forecast performance, since the method corrects for systematic errors in the irradiance forecast. The relative root mean square error (RMSE) for PO is in the range of 10.3\%e14.0\% of the nameplate capacity, and the forecast skill ranges from 13\% to 23\% over a persistence model. Over three years, an over-prediction of the daily PO exceeding 40\% only occurs twice at one of the two plants under study, while the spatially averaged PO of the paired plants never exceeds this threshold.},

	abstract = {We describe new optically thin solutions for rotating accretion flows around black holes and neutron stars. These solutions are advection dominated, so that most of the viscously dissipated energy is advected radially with the flow. We model the accreting gas as a two-temperature plasma and include cooling by bremsstrahlung, synchrotron, and Comptonization. We obtain electron temperatures Te 108.5-1010 K. The new solutions are present only for mass accretion rates Mṡcrit less than a critical rate A crit which we calculate as a function of radius R and viscosity parameter α. For Mṡ {\textless} Mṡcrit we show that there are three equilibrium branches of solutions. One of the branches corresponds to a cool optically thick flow which is the well-known thin disk solution of Shakura \& Sunyaev Another branch corresponds to a hot optically thin flow, discovered originally by Shapiro, Lightman, \& Eardley (SLE). This solution is thermally unstable. The third branch corresponds to our new advection-dominated solution. This solution is hotter and more optically thin than the SLE solution but is viscously and thermally stable. It is related to the ion torus model of Rees et al. and may potentially explain the hard X-ray and γ-ray emission from X-ray binaries and active galactic nuclei. For Mṡ {\textless} Mṡcrit, our work suggests that an accretion flow can choose between two distinct states, namely, the thin disk solution and the new advection-dominated solution, both of which are apparently stable. We argue that, in certain circumstances, it is only the latter solution that is truly stable, and that a thin disk will spontaneously evaporate and convert itself into an advection-dominated flow. Even for Mṡcrit we suggest that a thin disk may evaporate partially so that a fraction of the accretion occurs via an advection-dominated hot corona. If these ideas are correct, then optically thin advection-dominated flows must be very widespread, possibly the most common form of sub-Eddington accretion in black holes. Our calculations indicate that advection-dominated accretion on black holes differs considerably from similar flows around neutron stars. The crucial physical difference, which has been mentioned previously in the literature, is that in the former the advected energy is lost into the hole, whereas in the latter it is thermalized and re-radiated at the stellar surface, thereby providing soft photons which can Compton-cool the accreting gas. We obtain Mṡcrit ∼ α2MṡEdd for accreting black holes, independent of the black hole mass, whereas it is ∼0.1α2MṡEdd for neutron stars. Advection-dominated accretion is therefore more likely to occur in accreting black holes, and these systems will be underluminous for their Mṡ because the bulk of the energy is advected into the hole rather than being radiated. We find that Te in accreting black hole flows rises up to ∼109 1010 K, compared to Te ∼ 108.5-109 K in neutron star systems. Spectra of accreting black holes are therefore expected to be harder than those of accreting neutron stars. Pair effects are also more likely in black hole systems, though only at higher A than those we consider.},

Paczynski's choice, known today as the "Paczynski-Wiita potential", proved to be very practical. It was used by numerous researchers in the black hole accretion theory, and became a standard tool in relativistic astrophysics. The model is an example of Paczynski's admired ability to invent "out of nowhere" simple ideas that were brilliant, deep and useful. Paczynski has guessed intuitively the form of the potential. However, it could be also derived by a a step-by-step formal procedure. I show the derivation here. My derivation is based on a standard definition of the relativistic "effective potential" in the Schwarzschild spacetime. The relativistic effective potential may be uniquely divided into its "gravitational" and "centrifugal" part. The gravitational part differs from the Paczynski-Wiita potential only by a constant.},

The potential obtained consists of three parts, interpreted as a purely Newtonian (gravitoelectric) term, a dragging (gravitomagnetic) term, and a space-geometry correction. The accuracy of the pseudo-Newtonian model is studied by a method which compares, systematically, two large sets of trajectories: geodesics in the Kerr spacetime versus test-particle trajectories in the pseudo-Newtonian field. It is suggested that every pseudo-Newtonian model should be submitted to analogous systematic analysis before it is used in astrophysical applications. A modified Newtonian potential which accounts for the frame-dragging effects can be a practical tool in studying stationary accretion discs. Non-stationary configurations are more complicated and we will not suggest to use this approach to such topics in accretion theory as gravitomagnetic oscillations of discs and their relation to quasi-periodic sources.},

The approach employed uses a pseudo-Newtonian potential which reproduces many of the important features of the Schwarzschild solution and is not explicitly dependent on the assumed form of the viscosity law, with a global energy conservation requirement and a critical local radiated flux. The resulting disks have cusps at their inner edges, which lie between the marginally bound and marginally stable orbits, and depend on the specified angular momentum distribution. Accretion rates can become very large, and the total luminosity can exceed the nominal Eddington luminosity due to geometrical effects, possibly leading to the formation of well-collimated beams. In addition, the thick models derived can be matched onto relatively thin disks beyond a certain transition radius.},

The structure and radiation spectrum of the disk depend, mainly on the rate of matter inflow A into the disk at its external boundary The dependence on the efficiency of mechanisms of angular momentum transport (connected with the magnetic field and turbulence) is weaker. If A = 1O- 3.1O-8 M0 the disk around the black hole is a year powerful source of X-ray radiation with hv 1- 10 keV and luminosity L 1O - 1038 erg/s. If the flux of the accreting matter decreases, the effective temperature of the radiation and the luminosity will drop. On the other hand, when M \&gt; 1O- M0 the optical luminosity year of the disk exceeds the solar value. The main contribution to the optical luminosity of the black hole arises from reradiation of that part of the X-ray and ultra-violet energy which is initially produced in the central high temperature regions of the disk and which is then absorbed by the low temperature outer regions. saturated by broad recombination and resonance emission lines. Variability, connected with the character of the motion of the black hole, with gas flows in a binary system and with eclipses, is possible. Under certain conditions, the hard radiation can evaporate the gas. This can counteract the matter inflow into the disk and lead to autoregulation of the accretion. If M 3. 10-8M0 the luminosity of the disk around year the black hole is stabilized at the critical level of L 1038 M erg A small fraction of the accreting M0 s matter falls under the gravitational radius whereas the major part of it flows out with high velocity from the central regions of the disk. The outfiowing matter is opaque to the disk radiation and completely transforms its spectrum. In consequence, at the supercritical regime of accretion the black hole may appear as a bright, hot, optical star with a strong outflow of matter Key words: black holes - binary systems - X-ray sources - accretion The optical radiation spectrum of such objects must be},

	abstract = {Methods. We used all available archival XMM-Newton data for the sources in our sample and extracted light curves in the 5−7 and 2−4 keV energy bands. We used these light curves and applied a thoroughly tested (through extensive numerical simulations) recipe to estimate time-lags that have minimal bias, approximately follow a Gaussian distribution, and have known errors. Using traditional χ2 minimisation techniques, we then ﬁtted the observed time-lags with two diﬀerent models: a phenomenological model where the time-lags have a power-law dependence on frequency, and a physical model, using the reverberation time-lags expected in the lamppost geometry. The latter were computed assuming a point-like primary X-ray source above a black hole surrounded by a neutral and prograde accretion disc with solar iron abundance. We took all relativistic eﬀects into account for various X-ray source heights, inclination angles, and black hole spin values.
Results. Given the available data, time-lags between the two energy bands can only be reliably measured at frequencies between ∼5 × 10−5 Hz and ∼10−3 Hz. The power-law and reverberation time-lag models can both ﬁt the data well in terms of formal statistical characteristics. When ﬁtting the observed time-lags to the lamp-post reverberation scenario, we can only constrain the height of the X-ray source. The data require, or are consistent with, a small ({\textless}∼10 gravitational radii) X-ray source height.
Conclusions. In principle, the 5−7 keV band, which contains most of the Fe Kα line emission, could be an ideal band for studying reverberation eﬀects, as it is expected to be dominated by the X-ray reﬂection component. We here carried out the best possible analysis with XMM-Newton data. Time-lags can be reliably estimated over a relatively narrow frequency range, and their errors are rather large. Nevertheless, our results are consistent with the hypothesis of X-ray reﬂection from the inner accretion disc.},

There have been a number of approximate MCMC algorithms that use sub-sampling ideas to reduce this computational burden, but with the drawback that these algorithms no longer target the true posterior distribution. We introduce a new family of Monte Carlo methods based upon a multi-dimensional version of the Zig-Zag process of (Bierkens, Roberts, 2017), a continuous time piecewise deterministic Markov process. While traditional MCMC methods are reversible by construction (a property which is known to inhibit rapid convergence) the Zig-Zag process offers a flexible non-reversible alternative which we observe to often have favourable convergence properties. We show how the Zig-Zag process can be simulated without discretisation error, and give conditions for the process to be ergodic. Most importantly, we introduce a sub-sampling version of the Zig-Zag process that is an example of an \{{\textbackslash}em exact approximate scheme\}, i.e. the resulting approximate process still has the posterior as its stationary distribution. Furthermore, if we use a control-variate idea to reduce the variance of our unbiased estimator, then the Zig-Zag process can be super-efficient: after an initial pre-processing step, essentially independent samples from the posterior distribution are obtained at a computational cost which does not depend on the size of the data.},

The radiative transfer formulation can handle 3D geometrical settings and structured objects with variations and gradients in the optical depths across the objects and along the line-of-sight. Such scenarios are applicable in calculations of photon emission from complex structured accretion flows around black holes and neutrino emission from remnant neutron tori in neutron-star mergers. We apply the formulation and demonstrate radiation transfer calculations for emission from accretion tori around rotating black holes. We consider two cases: idealised optically thick tori that have a sharply defined emission boundary surface, and structured tori that allow variations in the absorption coefficient and emissivity within the tori. We show intensity images and emission spectra of the tori obtained in our calculations. Our findings in the radiative transfer calculations are summarised as follows. (i) Geometrical effects, such as lensing-induced self-occulation and multiple-image contribution are much more significant in accretion tori than geometrically thin accretion disks. (ii) Optically thin accretion tori show emission line profiles distinguishable from the profiles of lines from optically thick accretion tori and lines from optically thick geometrically thin accretion disks. (iii) The line profiles of the optically thin accretion tori have a weaker dependence on the viewing inclination angle than those of the optically thick accretion tori or accretion disks, especially at high viewing inclination angles. (iv) Limb effects are present in accretion tori with finite optical depths, due to density and temperature stratification within the tori. We note that in accretion flows onto relativistic compact objects, gravitationally induced line resonance can occur. This resonance occurs easily in 3D flows, but not in 2D flows, such as a thin accretion disk around a black hole.},

Using a computational grid that spans more than two decades in radius, we compare the time-averaged properties of the flow with previous hydrodynamical simulations. The net mass accretion rate is small compared with the mass inflow and outflow rates at large radii associated with turbulent eddies. Turbulence is driven by the MRI rather than convection. The two-dimensional structure of the time-averaged flow is significantly different compared with the hydrodynamical case. We discuss the limitations imposed on our results by the assumption of axisymmetry and the relatively small radial domain.},

Classical calculations predict that this radiation is highly polarized at large inclination angles, in contrast to observations of quasars and Seyfert galaxies. We have calculated the spectrum and polarization of such discs using an improved radiative transfer method with all the relevant opacity sources, and a full general relativistic treatment of the radiation propagation. We find the overall polarization to be much smaller than previously suggested. At low
frequencies the disc opacity significantly reduces its polarization while at high frequencies general relativistic effects depolarize the radiation. The calculated degree of polarization, and its wavelength dependence, are consistent with the available observations. We predict that the degree of polarization should show a distinct broad feature near the Lyman edge, and that the polarization plane should rotate at high frequencies. The first effect will confirm the thermal nature of the observed UV radiation and the second the existence of massive black holes at the centre of AGN.},

Population proportions arise frequently as quantities of interest in astronomical research; for instance, in studies aiming to constrain the bar fraction, AGN fraction, SMBH fraction, merger fraction, or red sequence fraction from counts of galaxies exhibiting distinct morphological features or stellar populations. However, two of the most widely-used techniques for estimating binomial conﬁdence intervals—the ‘normal approximation’ and the Clopper \& Pearson approach—are liable to misrepresent the degree of statistical uncertainty present under sampling conditions routinely encountered in astronomical surveys, leading to an ineﬀective use of the experimental data (and, worse, an ineﬃcient use of the resources expended in obtaining that data). Hence, I provide here an overview of the fundamentals of binomial statistics with two principal aims: (i) to reveal the ease with which (Bayesian) binomial conﬁdence intervals with more satisfactory behaviour may be estimated from the quantiles of the beta distribution using modern mathematical software packages (e.g. R, matlab, mathematica, IDL, python); and (ii) to demonstrate convincingly the major ﬂaws of both the ‘normal approximation’ and the Clopper \& Pearson approach for error estimation.},

Often however, simple and even unphysical models are adopted to represent the X-ray spectra of AGN, which do not capture the complexity and diversity of the observations. In the case of blank field surveys in particular, this should have an impact on e.g. the determination of the AGN luminosity function, the inferred accretion history of the Universe and also on our understanding of the relation between AGN and their host galaxies. {\textless}i{\textgreater}Methods. {\textless}i/{\textgreater}We develop a Bayesian framework for model comparison and parameter estimation of X-ray spectra. We take into account uncertainties associated with both the Poisson nature of X-ray data and the determination of source redshift using photometric methods. We also demonstrate how Bayesian model comparison can be used to select among ten different physically motivated X-ray spectral models the one that provides a better representation of the observations. This methodology is applied to X-ray AGN in the 4 Ms {\textless}i{\textgreater}Chandra {\textless}i/{\textgreater}Deep Field South.{\textless}i{\textgreater}Results. {\textless}i/{\textgreater}For the {\textasciitilde}350 AGN in that field, our analysis identifies four components needed to represent the diversity of the observed X-ray spectra: (1) an intrinsic power law; (2) a cold obscurer which reprocesses the radiation due to photo-electric absorption, Compton scattering and Fe-K fluorescence; (3) an unabsorbed power law associated with Thomson scattering off ionised clouds; and (4) Compton reflection, most noticeable from a stronger-than-expected Fe-K line. Simpler models, such as a photo-electrically absorbed power law with a Thomson scattering component, are ruled out with decisive evidence ({\textless}i{\textgreater}B{\textless}i/{\textgreater} {\textgreater} 100). We also find that ignoring the Thomson scattering component results in underestimation of the inferred column density, {\textless}i{\textgreater}N{\textless}i/{\textgreater}{\textless}sub{\textgreater}H{\textless}sub/{\textgreater}, of the obscurer. Regarding the geometry of the obscurer, there is strong evidence against both a completely closed (e.g. sphere), or entirely open (e.g. blob of material along the line of sight), toroidal geometry in favour of an intermediate case. {\textless}i{\textgreater}Conclusions. {\textless}i/{\textgreater}Despite the use of low-count spectra, our methodology is able to draw strong inferences on the geometry of the torus. Simpler models are ruled out in favour of a geometrically extended structure with significant Compton scattering. We confirm the presence of a soft component, possibly associated with Thomson scattering off ionised clouds in the opening angle of the torus. The additional Compton reflection required by data over that predicted by toroidal geometry models, may be a sign of a density gradient in the torus or reflection off the accretion disk. Finally, we release a catalogue of AGN in the CDFS with estimated parameters such as the accretion luminosity in the 2−10 keV band and the column density, {\textless}i{\textgreater}N{\textless}i/{\textgreater}{\textless}sub{\textgreater}H{\textless}sub/{\textgreater}, of the obscurer.},

Our goals are to ascertain to what extent the torus paradigm of local AGN is applicable at earlier epochs and to evaluate the evolution of the Compton thick fraction with redshift, important for X-ray background synthesis models and understanding the accretion history of the Universe. In addition to the torus models, we measure the fraction of scattered nuclear light, fscatt, known to be dependent on the covering factor of the circumnuclear material, and use this to aid in our understanding of its geometry. We find that the covering factor of the circumnuclear material is correlated with the line-of-sight column density NH, and as such the most heavily obscured AGN are in fact also the most geometrically buried. We come to these conclusions from the result that fscatt decreases as NH increases and from the prevalence of the torus model with the smallest opening angle as the best-fitting model in the fits to the most obscured AGN. We find that a significant fraction of sources (∼20 per cent) in the CDFS are likely to be buried in material with close to 4π coverage having been best fitted by the torus model with a 0° opening angle. Furthermore, we find 41 Compton thick sources in the CDFS using the new torus models, 29 of which we report here for the first time. We bin our sample by redshift in order to investigate the evolution of the Compton thick fraction by epoch. We take into account the incompleteness and contamination rates in the spectral identification of Compton thick AGN using data from simulations. We also account for the bias against the X-ray selection of heavily obscured sources due to flux suppression in the Chandra band, by restricting to intrinsic luminosities at which the CDFS is sensitive to Compton thick AGN (LX∼ 1044 at z= 2.5). We find a significant increase in the intrinsic Compton thick fraction, normalized to LX= 1043.5 erg s−1, from ≈20 per cent in the local Universe to ≈40 per cent at z=1 - 4.},

	abstract = {For decades researchers have studied the On/Off counting problem where a measured rate consists of two parts. One part is due to a signal process and the other is due to a background process, the magnitudes for both of which are unknown. While most frequentist methods are adequate for large number counts, they cannot be applied to sparse data. Here, I want to present a new objective Bayesian solution that only depends on three parameters: the number of events in the signal region, the number of events in the background region, and the ratio of the exposure for both regions. First, the probability of the counts only being due to background is derived analytically. Second, the marginalized posterior for the signal parameter is also derived analytically. With this two-step approach it is easy to calculate the signal’s signiﬁcance, strength, uncertainty, or upper limit in a uniﬁed way. This approach is valid without restrictions for any number count, including zero, and may be widely applied in particle physics, cosmic-ray physics, and high-energy astrophysics. In order to demonstrate the performance of this approach, I apply the method to gamma-ray burst data.},

	abstract = {We present detailed evidence for a warm absorber in the Seyfert 1 galaxy MCG Ϫ6-30-15 and dispute earlier claims for relativistic O line emission. The High-Energy Transmission Grating spectra show numerous narrow, unresolved (FWHM Շ 200 km sϪ1) absorption lines from a wide range of ionization states of N, O, Mg, Ne, Si, S, Ar, and Fe. The O vii edge and the 1s2–1sn p resonance line series to n p 9 are clearly detected at rest in the active galactic nucleus frame. We attribute previous reports of an apparently highly redshifted O vii edge to the 1s2–1sn p (n 1 5) O vii resonance lines and a neutral Fe L absorption complex. The shape of the Fe L feature is nearly identical to that seen in the spectra of several X-ray binaries and in laboratory data. The implied dust column density agrees with that obtained from reddening studies and gives the ﬁrst direct X-ray evidence for dust embedded in a warm absorber. The O viii resonance lines and the weak edge are also detected, and the spectral rollover below ∼2 keV is explained by the superposition of numerous absorption lines and edges. We identify, for the ﬁrst time, a KLL resonance in the O vi photoabsorption cross section, giving a measure of the O vi column density. The O vii (f) emission detected at the systemic velocity implies a covering fraction of ∼5\% (depending on the observed vs. time-averaged ionizing ﬂux). Our observations show that a dusty warm absorber model is not only adequate to explain all the spectral features տ0.48 keV (Շ26 A˚ ) but that the data require it. This contradicts the interpretation of Branduardi-Raymont and coworkers that this spectral region is dominated by highly relativistic line emission from the vicinity of the black hole.},

	abstract = {We present a detailed study of the long time-scale X-ray variability of the Seyfert 1 Galaxy MCG–6-30-15, based on eight years of frequent monitoring observations with the Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer. When combined with the published short-time-scale XMM—Newton observations, we derive the power-spectral density (PSD) covering six decades of frequency from ∼10−8 to ∼10−2 Hz. As with NGC 4051, another narrow-line Seyfert 1 galaxy (NLS1), we find that the PSD of MCG–6-30-15 is a close analogue of the PSD of a galactic black hole X-ray binary system (GBH) in a ‘high’ rather than a ‘low’ state. As with NGC 4051 and the GBH Cygnus X-1 in its high state, a smoothly bending model is a better fit to the PSD of MCG–6-30-15, giving a derived break frequency of 7.6+10−3 × 10−5 Hz. Assuming linear scaling of the break frequency with black hole mass, we estimate the black hole mass in MCG–6-30-15 to be ∼2.9+1.8−1.6× 106 M⊙.Although, in the X-ray band, it is one of the best observed Seyfert galaxies, there has as yet been no accurate determination of the mass of the black hole in MCG–6-30-15. Here we present a mass determination using the velocity dispersion (MBH−σ*) technique and compare it with estimates based on the width of the Hα line. Depending on the calibration relationship assumed for the MBH−σ* relationship, we derive a mass of between 3.6 and 6 × 106 M⊙, consistent with the mass derived from the PSD.Using the newly derived mass and break time-scale, and revised reverberation masses for other active galactic nuclei (AGN) from Peterson et al., we update the black hole mass—break-time-scale diagram. The observations are still generally consistent with narrow-line Seyfert 1 galaxies having shorter break time-scales, for a given mass, than broad-line AGN, probably reflecting a higher accretion rate. However, the revised, generally higher, masses (but unchanged break time-scales) are also consistent with perhaps all of the X-ray bright AGN studied so far being high-state objects. This result may simply be a selection effect, based on their selection from high-flux X-ray all-sky catalogues, and their consequent typically high X-ray/radio ratios, which indicate high-state systems.},

In addition to the change in strength, the line profile also appears to be different in higher luminosity sources.

We compare its performance to grid-based algorithms, showing that the efﬁciency in CPU time is ∼100 times better for MCMC for a threedimensional parameter space and increasing with the number of dimensions. We use GalMC to ﬁt the stacked SEDs of two samples of Lyman alpha emitters (LAEs) at redshift z = 3.1. Our ﬁt reveals that the typical LAE detected in the IRAC 3.6 μm band has age = 0.67 [0.37–1.81] Gyr and stellar mass = 3.2 [2.5–4.2] ×109 M , while the typical LAE not detected at 3.6 μm has age = 0.06 [0.01–0.2] Gyr and stellar mass = 2 [1.1–3.4] ×108 M . The SEDs of both stacks are consistent with the absence of dust. The data do not signiﬁcantly prefer exponential with respect to constant star formation history. The stellar populations of these two samples are consistent with the previous study by Lai et al., with some differences due to the improved modeling of the stellar populations.

AGNﬁtter makes use of a large library of theoretical, empirical, and semi-empirical models to characterize both the nuclear and host galaxy emission simultaneously. The model consists of four physical emission components: an accretion disk, a torus of AGN heated dust, stellar populations, and cold dust in star-forming regions. AGNﬁtter determines the posterior distributions of numerous parameters that govern the physics of AGNs with a fully Bayesian treatment of errors and parameter degeneracies, allowing one to infer integrated luminosities, dust attenuation parameters, stellar masses, and star-formation rates. We tested AGNﬁtter’s performance on real data by ﬁtting the SEDs of a sample of 714 X-ray selected AGNs from the XMM-COSMOS survey, spectroscopically classiﬁed as Type1 (unobscured) and Type2 (obscured) AGNs by their optical–UV emission lines. We ﬁnd that two independent model parameters, namely the reddening of the accretion disk and the column density of the dusty torus, are good proxies for AGN obscuration, allowing us to develop a strategy for classifying AGNs as Type1 or Type2, based solely on an SED-ﬁtting analysis. Our classiﬁcation scheme is in excellent agreement with the spectroscopic classiﬁcation, giving a completeness fraction of {\textasciitilde}86\% and {\textasciitilde}70\%, and an efﬁciency of {\textasciitilde}80\% and {\textasciitilde}77\%, for Type1 and Type2 AGNs, respectively.},

	abstract = {We review the timing and spectral evolution of black hole X-ray binary systems, with emphasis on the current accretion-ejection paradigm. When in outburst, stellar mass black hole binaries may become the brightest X-ray sources in the sky. Analysis of high signal to noise data has resulted in a general framework of correlated X-ray spectral and fast timing behavior during an outburst. We utilize recent data from small but powerful observatories launched in the last decade supported by multi-wavelength ground-based observations. Coordinated observations showed that outflows (in the form of jets and winds) are an integral part of this evolution, providing a coherent phenomenological picture that we discuss in terms of the hardness-intensity diagram and spectral states. We pay particular attention to the evolution of broad and narrow emission and absorption lines and hard tails in the energy spectrum, quasi-periodic oscillations, lags and reverberation from fast timing studies, making the connections with multi-wavelength observations when relevant. We use the bright outburst of MAXI J1820+070 as a recent test case to discuss different aspects of spectral and timing evolution, but the data and results are not limited to this source. In the second part of the review, we discuss competing theoretical models that can explain different aspects of the rich phenomenology. Data from future missions and simulation results will have the power to resolve discrepancies in these models and black hole binary research will continue to be an exciting field that allows for tests of fundamental physics and studies of the properties of matter in strong gravitational fields.},

Although it is possible for one to obtain asymptotically (A)dS solutions using our setup, in the context of the present work, we are solely interested in asymptotically ﬂat solutions. At ﬁrst, we study the properties of static and spherically symmetric black-hole solutions emanating from both regular and phantom scalar ﬁelds. We ﬁnd that the regular-scalar-ﬁeld-induced solutions are solutions describing ultra-compact black holes, while the phantom scalar ﬁelds generate ultra-sparse black-hole solutions. The latter are black holes that can be potentially of very low density since, contrary to ultra-compact ones, their horizon radius is always greater than the horizon radius of the corresponding Schwarzschild black hole of the same mass. Then, we generalize the above static solutions to slowly rotating ones and compute their angular velocities explicitly. Finally, the study of the axial perturbations of the derived solutions takes place, in which we show that there is always a region in the parameter space of the free parameters of our theory that allows the existence of both ultra-compact and ultra-sparse black holes.},

On top of solving the generalrelativistic magnetohydrodynamics and the Einstein equations with conformally ﬂat approximations, the code solves the evolution equations of the zeroth- and ﬁrst-order moments of the radiations. Analytic closure relation is used to obtain the higher order moments and close the system. The ﬁnite-volume discretisation has been adopted for the radiation moments. The advection in spatial and frequency spaces are handled explicitly. In addition, the radiation-matter interaction terms, which are very stiﬀ in the optically thick region, are solved implicitly. Implicit-explicit Runge-Kutta schemes are adopted for time integration. We test the implementation with a number of numerical benchmarks from frequency-integrated to frequency dependent cases. Furthermore, we also illustrate the astrophysical applications in hot neutron star and core-collapse supernovae modellings, and compare with other neutrino transport codes.},

We have performed a detailed comparison of RAPTOR output with that of other radiative-transfer codes and demonstrate convergence of the results. We then applied RAPTOR to study accretion models of supermassive black holes, performing time-dependent radiative transfer through general relativistic magneto-hydrodynamical (GRMHD) simulations and investigating the expected observational diﬀerences between the so-called fastlight and slow-light paradigms.
Results. Using RAPTOR to produce synthetic images and light curves of a GRMHD model of an accreting black hole, we ﬁnd that the relative diﬀerence between fast-light and slow-light light curves is less than 5\%. Using two distinct radiative-transfer codes to process the same data, we ﬁnd integrated ﬂux densities with a relative diﬀerence less than 0.01\%.
Conclusions. For two-dimensional GRMHD models, such as those examined in this paper, the fast-light approximation suﬃces as long as errors of a few percent are acceptable. The convergence of the results of two diﬀerent codes demonstrates that they are, at a minimum, consistent.},

The reverberation lag resulting from the path-length difference between direct and reﬂected emission provides a powerful tool to probe the innermost regions around both stellar-mass and supermassive black holes. Here, we present for the ﬁrst time a reverberation mapping formalism that enables modelling of energy-dependent time lags and variability amplitude for a wide range of variability time-scales, taking the complete information of the cross-spectrum into account. We use a pivoting power-law model to account for the spectral variability of the continuum that dominates over the reverberation lags for longer time-scale variability. We use an analytic approximation to self-consistently account for the non-linear effects caused by this continuum spectral variability, which have been ignored by all previous reverberation studies. We ﬁnd that ignoring these non-linear effects can bias measurements of the reverberation lags, particularly at low frequencies. Since our model is analytic, we are able to ﬁt simultaneously for a wide range of Fourier frequencies without prohibitive computational expense. We also introduce a formalism of ﬁtting to real and imaginary parts of our cross-spectrum statistic, which naturally avoids some mistakes/inaccuracies previously common in the literature. We perform proof-of-principle ﬁts to Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer data of Cygnus X-1.},

We study the influence of the tidal charge onto profiled spectral lines generated by radiating tori orbiting in vicinity of a rotating black hole. We show that with lowering the negative tidal charge of the black hole, the profiled line becomes to be flatter and wider keeping their standard character with flux stronger at the blue edge of the profiled line. The extension of the line grows with radius falling and inclination angle growing. With growing inclination angle a small hump appears in the profiled lines due to the strong lensing effect of photons coming from regions behind the black hole. For positive tidal charge (b {\textgreater} 0) and high inclination angles two small humps appear in the profiled lines close to the red and blue edge of the lines due to the strong lensing effect. We can conclude that for all values of b, the strongest effect on the profiled lines shape (extension) is caused by the changes of the inclination angle.},

Since many of the simulations presented in the literature use different combinations of algorithms it is important to quantify the diﬀerences in jet evolution that can arise due to the precise numerical schemes used. We conduct a series of simulations using the FLASH (magneto-)hydrodynamics code in which we vary the Riemann solver and spatial reconstruction schemes to determine their impact on the evolution and dynamics of the jets. For highly reﬁned grids the variation in the simulation results introduced by the diﬀerent combinations of spatial reconstruction scheme and Riemann solver is typically small. A high level of convergence is found for simulations using third order spatial reconstruction with the HLLC and Hybrid Riemann solvers.},

We incorporate these emissivity proﬁles into relxill nk and we simulate some observations of a black hole binary with NuSTAR to study the impact of a disk-like coronal geometry on the measurement of the properties of the system and, in particular, on the possibility of testing the Kerr nature of the source. We ﬁnd that, in general, the astrophysical properties of the accretion disk are recovered well even if we ﬁt the data with a model employing a broken power-law or a lamppost emissivity proﬁle, while it is more challenging to constrain the geometric properties of the black hole spacetime.},

	abstract = {It has been thought for decades that rotating black holes (BHs) power the energetic gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) and active galactic nuclei (AGNs), but the mechanism that extracts the BH energy has remained elusive. We here show that the solution to this problem arises when the BH is immersed in an external magnetic field and ionized low-density matter. For a magnetic field parallel to the BH spin, the induced electric field accelerates electrons outward and protons inward at spherical polar angles \$-60{\textasciicircum}{\textbackslash}circ{\textbackslash}lesssim {\textbackslash}theta {\textbackslash}lesssim 60{\textasciicircum}{\textbackslash}circ\$ (hereafter polar region), and vice versa at \$60{\textasciicircum}{\textbackslash}circ{\textbackslash}lesssim {\textbackslash}theta {\textbackslash}lesssim 120{\textasciicircum}{\textbackslash}circ\$ (hereafter equatorial region). For an antiparallel magnetic field, protons and electrons exchange their roles. The particles that are accelerated outward radiate off energy and angular momentum to infinity. The BH powers the process by reducing its energy and angular momentum by capturing polar protons and equatorial electrons with net negative energy and angular momentum. The electric potential allows for negative energy states outside the BH ergosphere, so the latter does not play any role in this electrodynamical BH energy extraction process.},

	abstract = {Some galaxies show little to no sign of active galactic nucleus (AGN) activity, yet exhibit strong coronal emission lines (CLs) relative to common narrow emission lines. Many of these coronal lines have ionization potentials of ≥ 100 eV, thus requiring strong extreme UV and/or soft X-ray ﬂux. It has long been thought that such events are powered by tidal disruption events (TDEs), but owing to a lack of detailed multi-wavelength follow-up, such a connection has not been ﬁrmly made. Here we compare coronal line emitters (CLEs) and TDEs in terms of their host-galaxy and transient properties. We ﬁnd that the mid-infrared (MIR) colors of CLE hosts in quiescence are similar to TDE hosts. Additionally, many CLEs show evidence of a large dust reprocessing echo in their mid-infrared colors, a sign of signiﬁcant dust in the nucleus. The stellar masses and star formation rates of the CLE hosts are consistent with TDE hosts, and both populations reside within the green valley. The blackbody properties of CLEs and TDEs are similar, with some CLEs showing hot (T ≥ 40, 000 K) blackbody temperatures. Finally, the location of CLEs on the peak-luminosity/decline-rate parameter space is much closer to TDEs than many other major classes of nuclear transients. Combined, these provide strong evidence to conﬁrm the previous claims that CLEs are indeed TDEs in gas-rich environments. We additionally propose a stricter threshold of CL ﬂux ≥ 1/3 × [O ] ﬂux to better exclude AGNs from the sample of CLEs.},

The intervals between these events vary randomly, but there are periods of greater activity, with shorter mean intervals, and of lesser activity, with longer mean intervals. A single dimensionless parameter, the width of a log-normal function ﬁtted to the distribution of waiting times between events, quantiﬁes the variability of the activity. This parameter describes its dynamics in analogy to the critical exponents and universality classes of renormalization group theory. If the distribution of event strengths is a power law, the width of the log-normal ﬁt is independent of the detection threshold and is a robust measure of the dynamics of the phenomenon.},

	abstract = {We study the properties of the Newtonian gravitational potential in a spherical Universe for different topologies. For this, we use the non-Euclidean Newtonian theory developed in Vigneron [2022, Class. \& Quantum Gravity, 39, 155006] describing Newtonian gravitation in a spherical or hyperbolic Universe. The potential is calculated for a point mass in all the globally homogeneous regular spherical topologies, i.e. whose fundamental domain is unique and is a platonic solid. We provide the exact solution and the Taylor expansion series of the potential at a test position near the point mass. We show that the odd terms of the expansion can be interpreted as coming from the presence of a non-zero spatial scalar curvature, while the even terms relate to the closed nature of the topological space. A consequence is that, compared to the point mass solution in a 3-torus, widely used in Newtonian cosmological simulations, the spherical cases all feature an additional attractive first order term dependent solely on the spatial curvature. The choice of topology only affects the potential at second order and higher. For typical estimates of cosmological scales (curvature and topology), the strongest topological effect occurs in the case of the Poincar{\textbackslash}'e dodecahedral space, but in general the effect of curvature dominates over topology. We also provide the set of equations that can be used to perform \$N\$-body simulations of structure formation in spherical topologies.},

Here, we propose an invariant method to characterize regions of repulsive gravity, associated to black holes and naked singularities. Our method is based upon the behavior of the curvature tensor eigenvalues, and leads to an invariant definition of a {\textbackslash}emph\{repulsion radius\}. The repulsion radius determines a physical region, which can be interpreted as a repulsion sphere, where the effects due to repulsive gravity naturally arise. Further, we show that the use of effective masses to characterize repulsive regions can lead to coordinate-dependent results whereas, in our approach, repulsion emerges as a consequence of the spacetime geometry in a completely invariant way. Our definition is tested in the spacetime of an electrically charged Kerr naked singularity and in all its limiting cases. We show that a positive mass can generate repulsive gravity if it is equipped with an electric charge or an angular momentum. We obtain reasonable results for the spacetime regions contained inside the repulsion sphere whose size and shape depend on the value of the mass, charge and angular momentum. Consequently, we define repulsive gravity as a classical relativistic effect by using the geometry of spacetime only.},

However, clear evidence for AGN diskembedded BHs is currently lacking. Here, as possible electromagnetic signatures of these BHs, we investigate breakout emission from shocks emerging around Blandford-Znajek jets launched from accreting BHs in AGN disks. We assume that the majority of the highly super-Eddington ﬂow reaches the BH, produces a strong jet, and the jet produces feedback that shuts oﬀ accretion and thus leads to episodic ﬂaring. While these assumptions are highly uncertain at present, they predict a breakout emission characterized by luminous thermal emission in the X-ray bands, and bright, broadband nonthermal emission from the infrared to the gamma-ray bands. The ﬂare duration depends on the BH’s distance r from the central supermassive BH, varying between 103 − 106 s for r ∼ 0.01 − 1 pc. This emission can be discovered by current and future infrared, optical, and X-ray wide-ﬁeld surveys and monitoring campaigns of nearby AGNs.},

	abstract = {Radial structure of accretion discs around compact objects is often described using analytic approximations which are derived from averaging or integrating vertical structure equations. For non-solar chemical composition, partial ionization, or for supermassive black holes, this approach is not accurate. Additionally, radial extension of ‘analytically-described’ disc zones is not evident in many cases. We calculate vertical structure of accretion discs around compact objects, with and without external irradiation, with radiative and convective energy transport taken into account. For this, we introduce a new open Python code, allowing diﬀerent equations of state (EoS) and opacity laws, including tabular values. As a result, radial structure and stability ‘S-curves’ are calculated for speciﬁc disc parameters and chemical composition. In particular, based on more accurate power-law approximations for opacity in the disc, we supply new analytic formulas for the farthest regions of the hot disc around stellar-mass object. On calculating vertical structure of a self-irradiated disc, we calculate a self-consistent value of the irradiation parameter 𝐶irr for stationary 𝛼-disc. We ﬁnd that, for a ﬁxed shape of the X-ray spectrum, 𝐶irr depends weakly on the accretion rate but changes with radius, and the dependence is driven by the conditions in the photosphere and disc opening angle. The hot zone extent depends on the ratio between irradiating and intrinsic ﬂux: corresponding relation for 𝑇irr, crit is obtained.},

Using isothermal ﬂuid, we examine the accretion and geodesic motion of particles in the vicinity of a spherically symmetric black hole spacetime in the Einstein-SU (N ) non-linear sigma model. In the accretion process, the disk-like structure is produced by the geodesic motion of particles near the black hole. We determine the innermost stable circular orbit, energy ﬂux, radiation temperature, and radioactive eﬃciency numerically. In the equatorial plane, we investigate the mobility of particles with stabilities that form circular orbits. We examine perturbations of a test particle by using restoring forces and particle oscillations in the vicinity of the black hole. We analyze the maximum accretion rate and critical ﬂow of the ﬂuid.

Diﬀerent scenarios are analyzed depending on what data are ﬁxed. The eﬃciency of the process is found, in particular near the horizon and for a photon rocket (when the ejected particle is massless). We prove directly that the most eﬃcient process occurs when fuel is ejected along the rocket trajectory. When this occurs on the horizon, the eﬃciency reaches 100 \% for a photon rocket. We compare two ways how a rocket can reverse its direction of motion to a black hole near the event horizon with restoring the initial energy-to-mass ratio: (i) by a single ejection or (ii) in the two-step process when it stops and moves back afterwards. For a nonphotonic rocket, in case (ii) a larger mass can be taken out from the vicinity of a horizon. For a photonic one, there is no diﬀerence between (i) and (ii) in this respect. We also consider brieﬂy the scenario when a rocket hangs over a black hole due to continuous ejection of fuel. Then, the fuel mass decays exponentially with the proper time.},

We use the X–ray (0.5–7.0 keV) data acquired with the Soft X-ray Telescope (SXT) and the UV (FUV: 130–180 nm, NUV: 200–300 nm) data obtained with the Ultra-Violet Imaging Telescope (UVIT). We also use the contemporaneous Swift observations of NGC 4593 and demonstrate AstroSat’s capability for X–ray/UV correlation studies. We performed UV/X-ray cross-correlation analysis using the Interpolated and the Discrete Cross-Correlation Functions and found similar results. In the case of NGC 4593, we found that the variations in the X-rays lead to those in the FUV and NUV bands by ∼ 38 ks and ∼ 44 ks, respectively. These UV lags favour the disk reprocessing model, they are consistent with the previous results within uncertainties. In contrast, we found an opposite trend in NGC 7469 where the soft X-ray variations lag those in the FUV and NUV bands by ∼ 41 ks and ∼ 49 ks, respectively. The hard lags in NGC 7469 favour the Thermal Comptonization model. Our results may provide direct observational evidence for the variable intrinsic UV emission from the accretion disk which acts as the seed for thermal Comptonization in a hot corona in a lamp-post like geometry. The non-detection of disk reverberation photons in NGC 7469, using AstroSat data, is most likely due to a high accretion rate resulting in a hot accretion disk and large intrinsic emission.},

We start with reviewing lensing in spherically symmetric Schwarzschild spacetime, showing how to calculate deﬂection angles before moving to the rotating counterpart, the Kerr metric. Furthermore, we extend our studies for a particular class of newly proposed solutions called black-bounce spacetimes and discuss throughout the review how to explore lensing in these spacetimes and how the various parameters can be constrained using available astrophysical and cosmological data.},

	abstract = {We investigate whether photon ring observations in black hole imaging are able to distinguish between the Kerr black hole in general relativity and alternative black holes that deviate from Kerr. Certain aspects of photon rings have been argued to be robust observables in Very-Long-Baseline Interferometry (VLBI) black hole observations which carry imprints of the underlying spacetime. The photon ring shape, as well as its Lyapunov exponent (which encodes the narrowing of successive photon subrings), are detailed probes of the underlying geometry; measurements thereof have been argued to provide a strong null test of general relativity and the Kerr metric. However, a more complicated question is whether such observations of the photon ring properties can distinguish between Kerr and alternative black holes. We provide a ﬁrst answer to this question by calculating photon rings of the Johannsen, Rasheed-Larsen, and Manko-Novikov black holes. We ﬁnd that large deviations from Kerr and large observer inclinations are needed to obtain measurable diﬀerences in the photon ring shape. In other words, the Kerr photon ring shape appears to be the universal shape even for deviating black holes at low inclinations. On the other hand, the Lyapunov exponent shows more marked variations for deviations from the Kerr metric. Our analysis lays out the groundwork to determine deviations from the Kerr spacetime in photon rings that are potentially detectable by future observing missions.},

Separating the circular orbits into four qualitatively different classes according to the sign of the canonical angular momentum of the motion and the orientation of the Lorentz force, we analyze the circular orbits using the so-called force formalism. We find the analytical solutions for the radial profiles of velocity, specific angular momentum, and specific energy of the circular orbits in dependence on the black-hole dimensionless spin and the magnetic field strength. The innermost stable circular orbits are determined for all four classes of the circular orbits. The stable circular orbits with an outward-oriented Lorentz force can extend to radii lower than the radius of the corresponding photon circular geodesic. We calculate the frequencies of the harmonic oscillatory motion of the charged particles in the radial and vertical directions related to the equatorial circular orbits and study the radial profiles of the radial, ωr; vertical, ωθ; and orbital, ωϕ, frequencies, finding significant differences in comparison to the epicyclic geodesic circular motion. The most important new phenomenon is the existence of toroidal charged particle epicyclic motion with ωr∼ωθ≫ωϕ that could occur around retrograde circular orbits with an outward-oriented Lorentz force. We demonstrate that for the rapidly rotating black holes the role of the “Wald induced charge” can be relevant.},

By assuming a continuous injection of particles at the spherical shell and by treating the black hole and a featureless accretion disk located in the equatorial plane as passive sinks of particles, we build a stationary accretion model. This may then serve as a toy model for plasma feeding an accretion disk around a charged and rotating black hole. Therefore, our new model is a direct generalization of the analytical accretion model introduced by E. Tejeda, P. A. Taylor, and J. C. Miller [Mon. Not. R. Astron. Soc. 429, 925 (2013)]. We use our generalized model to analyze the influence of a net charge of the black hole, which will in general be very small, on the accretion of plasma. Within the assumptions of our model we demonstrate that already a vanishingly small charge of the black hole may in general still have a non-negligible effect on the motion of the plasma, as long as the electromagnetic field of the plasma is still negligible. Furthermore, we argue that the inner and outer edges of the forming accretion disk strongly depend on the charge of the accreted plasma. The resulting possible configurations of accretion disks are analyzed in detail.},

	abstract = {The Galactic centre supermassive black hole (SMBH), in sharp contrast with its complex environment, is characterized by only three classical parameters – mass, spin, and electric charge. Its charge is poorly constrained. It is, however, usually assumed to be zero because of neutralization due to the presence of plasma. We revisit the question of the SMBH charge and put realistic limits on its value, time-scales of charging and discharging, and observable consequences of the potential, small charge associated with the Galactic centre black hole. The electric charge due to classical arguments based on the mass difference between protons and electrons is \$\{{\textbackslash}lesssim \} 10{\textasciicircum}9{\textbackslash}, \{{\textbackslash}rm C\}\$ and is of a transient nature on the viscous time-scale. However, the rotation of a black hole in magnetic field generates electric field due to the twisting of magnetic field lines. This electric field can be associated with induced charge, for which we estimate an upper limit of \$\{{\textbackslash}lesssim \} 10{\textasciicircum}\{15\}{\textbackslash}, \{{\textbackslash}rm C\}\$. Moreover, this charge is most likely positive due to an expected alignment between the magnetic field and the black hole spin. Even a small charge of this order significantly shifts the position of the innermost stable circular orbit (ISCO) of charged particles. In addition, we propose a novel observational test based on the presence of the bremsstrahlung surface brightness decrease, which is more sensitive for smaller unshielded electric charges than the black hole shadow size. Based on this test, the current upper observational limit on the charge of Sgr A* is \$\{{\textbackslash}lesssim \} 3{\textbackslash}times 10{\textasciicircum}\{8\}{\textbackslash}, \{{\textbackslash}rm C\}\$.},

The EHT image of Sgr A* is consistent with a Kerr black hole’s expected appearance, and the results directly prove the existence of a supermassive black hole at the center of the Milky Way. Here, we use the EHT observational results for Sgr A* to investigate the constraints on its charge with the aid of Kerr-like black holes, paying attention to three leading rotating models, namely Kerr–Newman, Horndeski, and hairy black holes. Modeling the supermassive black hole Sgr A* as these Kerr-like black holes, we observe that the EHT results of Sgr A* place more strict upper limits on the parameter space of Kerr–Newman and Horndeski black holes than those placed by the EHT results for M87*. A systematic bias analysis reveals that, observational results of future EHT experiments place more precise limits on the charge of black hole Sgr A*. Thus, the Kerr-like black holes and Kerr black holes are indiscernible in a substantial region of the EHT-constrained parameter space; the claim is substantiated by our bias analysis.},

The nature of such fields is assessed with two families of observers, the locally non-rotating ones and those of vanishing Poynting flux. The velocity fields of the vanishing-Poynting observers in the locally non-rotating reference frames are determined using the 3+1 decomposition formalism. From a methodological point of view, and considering a classification of the electromagnetic field based on its invariants, it is convenient to separate the consideration of the vanishing-Poynting observers into two cases corresponding to the pure and non-pure fields, additionally if there are regions where the field rotates with the speed of light (light surfaces) it becomes necessary to split these observers into two subfamilies. We present several examples of relevance in astrophysics and general relativity, such as pure rotating dipolar-like magnetic fields and the electromagnetic field of the Kerr-Newman solution. For the latter example, we see that vanishing-Poynting observers also measure a vanishing super-Poynting vector, confirming recent results in the literature. Finally, for all non-null electromagnetic fields, we present the 4-velocity fields of vanishing Poynting observers in an arbitrary spacetime.},

Importantly, the radial profile of the scalar refractive index is finite along all trajectories except at the point of rotation reversal for counter-rotating geodesics. Construction of these analogues is feasible with available ordinary materials. A finite-difference frequency-domain solver of Maxwell's equations is used to simulate light trajectories around a variety of Kerr-Newman black holes.

The review discusses the Penrose process, the four laws of black hole mechanics, uniqueness of the solution, and the no-hair theorems. It also includes Kerr perturbation theory and its application to black hole stability and quasi-normal modes. The Kerr metric's importance in the astrophysics of quasars and accreting stellar-mass black hole systems is detailed. A theme of the review is the "miraculous" nature of the solution, both in describing in a simple analytic formula the most general rotating black hole, and in having unexpected mathematical properties that make many calculations tractable. Also included is a pedagogical derivation of the solution suitable for a first course in general relativity.},

	abstract = {Measurements of the angular momentum (spin) of astrophysical black holes are extremely important, as they provide information on the black hole formation and evolution. We present simulated observations of a X-ray binary system with the Imaging X-ray Polarimetry Explorer (IXPE), with the aim to study the robustness of black hole spin and geometry measurements using X-ray polarimetry. As a representative example, we used the parameters of GRS 1915+105 in its former unobscured, soft state. In order to simulate the polarization properties, we modeled the source emission with a multicolor blackbody accounting for thermal radiation from the accretion disk, including returning radiation. Our analysis shows that the polarimetric observations in the X-ray waveband will be able to estimate both spin and inclination of the system with a good precision (without returning radiation we obtained for the lowest spin \${\textbackslash}Delta a {\textbackslash}leq 0.4\$ (0.4/0.998 \${\textbackslash}sim\$ 40\%) for spin and \${\textbackslash}Delta i {\textbackslash}leq 30{\textasciicircum}{\textbackslash}circ\$ (30\${\textasciicircum}{\textbackslash}circ\$/70\${\textasciicircum}{\textbackslash}circ\$ \${\textbackslash}sim\$ 43\%) for inclination, while for the higher spin values we obtained \${\textbackslash}Delta a {\textbackslash}leq 0.12\$ (\${\textbackslash}sim\$ 12\%) for spin and \${\textbackslash}Delta i {\textbackslash}leq 20{\textasciicircum}{\textbackslash}circ\$ (\$ {\textbackslash}sim \$ 29\%) for inclination, within 1\$ {\textbackslash}sigma \$ errors). When focusing on the case of returning radiation and treating inclination as a known parameter, we were able to successfully reconstruct spin and disk albedo in \${\textbackslash}Delta a {\textbackslash}leq 0.15\$ (\${\textbackslash}sim\$ 15\%) interval and \${\textbackslash}Delta\$ albedo \${\textbackslash}leq 0.45\$ (45\%) intervals within 1\$ {\textbackslash}sigma \$ errors. We conclude that X-ray polarimetry will be a useful tool to constrain black hole spins, in addition to timing and spectral-fitting methods.},

In the wake of the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) observations of the supermassive black hole M87*, a recent surge in interest in black hole shadows suggests comparing the black holes in general relativity and modified theories of gravity to assess these models’ differences. Motivated by this, we take on an extensive study of the rotating hairy Kerr black holes, which encompasses, in particular cases, the Kerr black hole (α = 0). We investigate ergosphere and shadows of the black holes to infer that their size and shape are affected due to the l0 and are found to harbour a richer chaotic structure. In particular, the hairy Kerr black holes possess smaller size but more distorted shadows when compared with Kerr black holes. We also estimate the parameters l0 and a associated with hairy Kerr black holes using the shadow observables. The inferred circularity deviation ΔC ≤ 0.1 for the M87* black hole is satisfied, whereas shadow angular diameter θd = 42 ± 3μas, within 1σ region, for a given choice of α, places bounds on the parameters a and l0. Interestingly, the shadow axial ratio obeying 1 \&lt; Dx ≲ 4/3 is in agreement with the EHT results and thus eventuates in the hairy Kerr black holes being suitable candidates for astrophysical black holes.},

	abstract = {The existence of quark matter inside the heaviest neutron stars has been the topic of numerous recent studies, many of them suggesting that a phase transition to strongly interacting conformal matter inside neutron stars is feasible. Here we examine this hybrid star scenario using various hadronic models, a constituent quark model with three quark flavours, and applying a smooth crossover transition between the two. Within a Bayesian framework, we rigorously study the effect of up-to-date constraints from neutron star observations on the equation-of-state parameters and various neutron star observables. Our results show that a pure quark core is only possible if the maximum mass of neutron stars is below \${\textbackslash}sim2.3{\textasciitilde}M\_{\textbackslash}odot\$. We also find, however, consistently with other studies, that a peak in the speed of sound, exceeding \$1/3\$, is highly favoured by astrophysical measurements, which might indicate the percolation of hadrons at \${\textbackslash}sim3-4n\_0\$. Even though our prediction for the phase transition parameters varies depending on the specific astrophysical constraints utilized, the position of the speed of sound peak only changes slightly, while the existence of pure quark matter below \${\textbackslash}sim4 n\_0\$ is disfavoured. Additionally, we present the difference in the upper bounds of radius estimates using the full probability density data and sharp cut-offs, and stress the necessity of using the former.},

Finally we have considered exponential metric in which both the temporal and spatial components are generalised exponential function of \$r\$. We have also studied some of their properties including throat radius, energy conditions, examined singularity, the metric in curvature coordinates, effective refractive index, ISCO and photon sphere, Regge-Wheeler potential and determined the curvature tensor. The radius of the throat is found to be consistent with the properties of wormholes and donot contain any types of singularities, which are given by \$r=m\$, \$r = {\textbackslash}frac\{-1+{\textbackslash}sqrt\{1+4{\textbackslash}alpha m\}\}\{2{\textbackslash}alpha\}\$, \$r={\textbackslash}frac\{-1+{\textbackslash}sqrt\{1+8{\textbackslash}alpha m\}\}\{4{\textbackslash}alpha\}\$...etc. Most interestingly, their throat radius is same for the same spatial component and the same range of values of \$m\$. In addition to these they also violate Null Energy Condition(NEC) near the throat. These newly constructed metrics form a new class of traversable wormhole.},

This complicates the calculation of black-hole quasi-normal mode frequencies in theories that extend/modify general relativity, because one generally has to calculate the eigenvalue spectrum of a two-dimensional partial differential equation (in the radial and angular variables) instead of an ordinary differential equation (in the radial variable). In this work, we show that if the background geometry is close to the Kerr one, the problem considerably simplifies. One can indeed compute the quasi-normal mode frequencies, at least at leading order in the deviation from Kerr, by solving an ordinary differential equation subject to suitable boundary conditions. Although our method is general, in this paper we apply it to scalar perturbations on top of a Kerr black hole with an anomalous quadrupole moment, or on top of a slowly rotating Kerr background.},

	title = {Gravitational capture of magnetic monopoles by primordial black holes in the early universe},
	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/2302.07002},
	abstract = {It is intriguing to ask whether the existence of primordial black holes (PBHs) in the early universe could significantly reduce the abundance of certain stable massive particles (SMP) via gravitational capture, after which the PBHs evaporate before BBN to avoid conflict with stringent bounds. For example, this mechanism is relevant to an alternative solution of the monopole problem proposed by Stojkovic and Freese, in which magnetic monopoles produced in the early universe are captured by PBHs, thus freeing inflation from having to occur during or after the corresponding phase transitions that produced the monopoles. In this work, we reanalyze the solution by modelling the capture process in the same way as the coexisting monopole annihilation, which exhibits typical features of a diffusive capture. A monochromatic PBH mass function and a radiation-dominated era before PBH evaporation are assumed. We found that for Pati-Salam monopoles corresponding to a symmetry breaking scale between \$10{\textasciicircum}\{10\}{\textbackslash},{\textbackslash}text\{GeV\}\$ and \$10{\textasciicircum}\{15\}{\textbackslash},{\textbackslash}text\{GeV\}\$, the capture rate is many orders of magnitude below what is needed to cause a significant reduction of the monopole density. The difference with respect to previous literature can be attributed to both the modelling of the capture process and also the assumption on the PBH mass function. Within our assumptions, we also found that the magnetic charge that is large enough to make an extremal magnetic black hole cosmologically stable cannot be obtained from magnetic charge fluctuation via monopole capture. The large magnetic charged required by cosmological stability can nevertheless be obtained from magnetic charge fluctuation at PBH formation, and if later the monopole abundance can be reduced significantly by some non-inflationary mechanism, long-lived near-extremal magnetic black holes of observational relevance might result.},

In particular, we consider a disc model with finite thickness. By fitting the disc reflection spectra in the data, we obtain a black hole spin of 0.87–0.99 (90 per cent confidence range) after taking the thickness of the disc into consideration. Spectral models with a grid of mass accretion rate from 0 to \$30\{\{{\textbackslash},{\textbackslash}rm per{\textbackslash},cent\}\}{\textbackslash},{\textbackslash}dot\{M\}\_\{{\textbackslash}rm Edd\}\$ are calculated for MCG−06-30-15. This result is obtained by considering a free disc reflection fraction parameter frefl and is consistent with previous measurements based on razor-thin disc models. Besides, an isotropic, point-like geometry, i.e. the ‘lamppost’ geometry, is assumed for the corona in our model. We find that such a geometry overestimates frefl in the data. Therefore, thin disc models with consistent ‘lamppost’ values of frefl provide a worse fit than ones with a free frefl parameter. We discuss possible reasons for the discrepancy between the observed and theoretical values of frefl at the end of the paper. Modifications for the over-simplified lamppost model might be needed when the thickness of the thin disc is considered in future work.},

The incorporation of arbitrary Lorentz and CPT violation into general relativity and other theories of gravity based on Riemann-Cartan geometries is discussed.

They leave the region of active energization after \$t\_\{{\textbackslash}rm esc\}\$, when they get captured by one of the outflowing flux ropes of reconnected plasma. We directly measure \$t\_\{{\textbackslash}rm esc\}\$ in our simulations and find that \$t\_\{{\textbackslash}rm esc\}{\textbackslash}sim t\_\{{\textbackslash}rm acc\}\$ for \${\textbackslash}sigma{\textbackslash}gtrsim \{{\textbackslash}rm few\}\$. This leads to a universal (i.e., \${\textbackslash}sigma\$-independent) power-law spectrum \$dN\_\{{\textbackslash}rm free\}/d{\textbackslash}gamma{\textbackslash}propto {\textbackslash}gamma{\textasciicircum}\{-1\}\$ for the particles undergoing active acceleration, and \$dN/d{\textbackslash}gamma{\textbackslash}propto {\textbackslash}gamma{\textasciicircum}\{-2\}\$ for the overall particle population. Our results help shedding light on the ubiquitous presence of power-law particle and photon spectra in astrophysical non-thermal sources.},

	abstract = {Accretion disc coronae (ADC) sources are very high inclination neutron star or black hole binaries, where the outer accretion ﬂow completely blocks a direct view of the central X-ray source. Instead, their observed weak X-rays are produced by scattering, line and recombination emission from highly ionised gas (the ADC) surrounding the source. The origin of this scattering material is still under debate. We use the ADC source 2S 0921-630 (V395 Car) to test whether it is consistent with a thermal-radiative wind produced by the central X-ray source illuminating the outer disc. This wind is clearly visible in blueshifted absorption lines in less highly inclined systems, where the source is seen directly through this material. Using the phenomenological photoionised plasma model, we ﬁrst characterise the parameter that creates emission lines observed in 2S0921 in XMM-Newton and Chandra data. Then we run the Monte Carlos radiation transfer simulation to get scattered/reprocessed emissions in the wind, with density and velocity structure obtained from the previous work. Our model agrees with all the wind emission lines in the Chandra high and medium energy grating spectra for an intrinsic source luminosity of 𝐿 {\textgreater} 0.2 𝐿Edd. This result strongly favours thermal-radiative winds as the origin of the ADC. We also show how high-resolution spectra via microcalorimeters can provide a deﬁnitive test by detecting blueshifted absorption lines.},

We show connections to a discontinuous Galerkin (DG) method analyzed by Cockburn, Guzm{\textbackslash}'an, and Wang (2009) that is very difficult to implement in general. Next, we demonstrate how this method can be implemented efficiently using summation by parts (SBP) operators, in particular in the context of SBP DG methods such as the DG spectral element method (DGSEM). The resulting scheme combines nice properties of both the hyperbolic and the elliptic point of view, in particular a high order of convergence of the gradients, which is one order higher than what one would usually expect from DG methods for elliptic problems.},

We show that schemes developed for the first-order system allow O(h) time step instead of O(h2) and converge very rapidly toward the steady state. Moreover, this extremely fast convergence comes with the solution gradients (viscous stresses/heat fluxes for the Navier–Stokes equations) simultaneously computed with the same order of accuracy as the main variable. The proposed schemes are formulated as residual-distribution schemes (but can also be identified as finite-volume schemes), directly on unstructured grids. We present numerical results to demonstrate the tremendous gains offered by the new diffusion schemes, driving the rise of explicit schemes in the steady state computation for diffusion problems.},

	abstract = {The study of neutrino pair annihilation into electron-positron pairs (\${\textbackslash}nu\{{\textbackslash}bar {\textbackslash}nu\}{\textbackslash}to e{\textasciicircum}-e{\textasciicircum}+\$) is astrophysically well-motivated because it is a possible powering mechanism for the gamma-ray bursts (GRBs). In this paper, we estimate the gamma-ray energy deposition rate (EDR) arising from the annihilation of the neutrino pairs in the equatorial plane of a slowly rotating black hole geometry modified by the broken Lorentz symmetry (induced by a background bumblebee vector field). More specifically, owing to the presence of a dimensionless Lorentz symmetry breaking (LSB) parameter \$l\$ arising from nonminimal coupling between the bumblebee field with nonzero vacuum expectation value and gravity, the metric solution in question differs from the standard slowly rotating Kerr black hole. By idealizing the thin accretion disk temperature profile in the two forms of isothermal and gradient around the bumblebee gravity-based slow rotating black hole, we investigate the influence of spontaneous LSB on the \${\textbackslash}nu\{{\textbackslash}bar {\textbackslash}nu\}\$-annihilation efficiency. For both profiles, we find that positive values of LSB parameter \$l{\textgreater}0\$ induce an enhancement of the EDR associated with the neutrino-antineutrino annihilation. Therefore, the process of powering the GRBs jets around bumblebee gravity modified slowly rotating geometry is more efficient in comparison with standard metric. Using the observed gamma-ray luminosity associated with different GRBs types (short, long, and ultra-long), we find, through the analysis of the EDR in the parameter space \$l-a\$ (\$a{\textasciicircum}2{\textbackslash}ll1\$), some allowed ranges for the LSB parameter \$l\$.},

Such a geometrical conﬁguration is suggested from X-ray observations and recently conﬁrmed by numerical simulations. Although turbulence in accretion ﬂows would broaden the split lines, future X-ray high-energy resolution satellites, XRISM and Athena, would be capable of seeing the Zeeman effect on the Fe lines in X-ray binaries in the case with the MAD conﬁguration. The signature of the Zeeman split lines would provide observational evidence for MAD.},

Using the vierbein formalism, it is shown that up to 10 Lorentz and diffeomorphism Nambu-Goldstone modes can appear and that they are contained within the 10 modes of the vierbein associated with gauge degrees of freedom in a Lorentz-invariant theory. A general treatment of spontaneous local Lorentz and diffeomorphism violation is given for various spacetimes, and the fate of the Nambu-Goldstone modes is shown to depend on both the spacetime geometry and the dynamics of the tensor field triggering the spontaneous Lorentz violation. The results are illustrated within the general class of bumblebee models involving vacuum values for a vector field. In Minkowski and Riemann spacetimes, the bumblebee model provides a dynamical theory generating a photon as a Nambu-Goldstone boson for spontaneous Lorentz violation. The Maxwell and Einstein-Maxwell actions are automatically recovered in axial gauge. Associated effects of potential experimental relevance include Lorentz-violating couplings in the matter and gravitational sectors of the Standard-Model Extension and unconventional Lorentz-invariant couplings. In Riemann-Cartan spacetime, the possibility also exists of a Higgs mechanism for the spin connection, leading to the absorption of the propagating Nambu-Goldstone modes into the torsion component of the gravitational field.},

Contrary to general expectations of a low, 1\% polarization degree (PD), the observed average PD was found to be a factor of 4 higher. Aligned with the jet position angle on the sky, the observed polarization favors geometry of the X-ray emission region stretched in the accretion disk plane. The high PD is, however, diﬃcult to reconcile with the low orbital inclination of the binary i ≈ 30◦. We suggest that this puzzle can be explained if the emitting plasma is outﬂowing with a mildly relativistic velocity 0.4 c. Our radiative transfer simulations show that Comptonization in the outﬂowing medium radiates X-rays with the degree and direction of polarization consistent with observations at i ≈ 30◦.},

Although a coherent search based on the likelihood ratio and Gaussian statistics has been established and utilized in many studies, this Gaussian-based method could be problematic for weak and short bursts which usually have very few counts. To deal with all bursts including weak ones, here we propose the coherent search in Poisson statistics. We studied the diﬀerence between Poisson-based and Gaussian-based search methods by Monte Carlo simulations, and ﬁnd that the Poisson-based search method has advantages compared to the Gaussian case especially for weak bursts. Our results show that, for very weak bursts with very low number of counts, the Poisson-based search can provide higher signiﬁcance than the Gaussian-based search, and its likelihood ratio (for background ﬂuctuation) still generally follows the 𝜒2 distribution, making the signiﬁcance estimation of searched bursts very convenient. Thus, we suggest that the coherent search based on Poisson likelihood ratio is more appropriate in the search for generic transients including very weak ones.},

	abstract = {MAXI J1820+070 is a transient black hole binary (BHB) discovered on 2018 March 11. The unprecedented rich statistics brought by the NICER X-ray telescope allows detailed timing analysis up to ∼1 kHz uncompromised by the photon shot noise. To estimate the time lags, the Fourier analysis was applied, which led to two diﬀerent conclusions for the system conﬁguration; one supporting the lamp-post conﬁguration with a stable accretion disk extending close to the innermost stable circular orbit and the other supporting the truncated accretion disk contracting with time. Using the same data set, we present the results based on the cross-correlation function (CCF). The CCF is calculated between two diﬀerent X-ray bands and one side is subtracted from the other side, which we call the diﬀerential CCF (dCCF). The soft and hard lags respectively of ∼0.03 and 3 s are clearly identiﬁed without being diluted by the spectral mixture, demonstrating the eﬀectiveness of the dCCF analysis. The evolution of these lags is tracked, along with spectral changes for the ﬁrst 120 days since the discovery. Both the dCCF and spectral ﬁtting results are interpreted that the soft lag is a reverberation lag between the Comptonized emission and the soft excess emission and that the hard lag is between the disk black body emission and the Comptonized emission. The evolution of these lags is in line with the picture of the truncated disk contracting with time.},

	abstract = {Accretion discs properties should deviate from standard theory when magnetic pressure exceeds the thermal pressure. To quantify these deviations, we present a systematic study of the dynamical properties of magnetically arrested discs (MADs), the most magnetized type of accretion disc. Using an artificial cooling function to regulate the gas temperature, we study MADs of three different thermal thicknesses, \$h\_{\textbackslash}mathrm\{th\}/r=0.3, 0.1\$ and \$0.03\$. We find that the radial structure of the disc is never mostly supported by the magnetic field. In fact, thin MADs are very near Keplerian. However, as discs gets colder, they become more magnetized and the largest deviations from standard theory appear in our thinnest disc with \$h\_{\textbackslash}mathrm\{th\}/r=0.03\$. In this case, the disc is much more extended vertically and much less dense than in standard theory because of vertical support from the turbulent magnetic pressure and wind-driven angular momentum transport that enhances the inflow speed. The thin disc also dissipates a lot of thermal energy outside of \$z/r = {\textbackslash}pm 0.03\$ and a significant fraction of this dissipation happens in mildly relativistic winds. The enhanced dissipation in low-density regions could possibly feed coronae in X-ray binaries (XRBs) and active galactic nuclei (AGN). Wind-driven accretion will also impact the dynamical evolution of accretion discs and could provide a mechanism to explain the rapid evolution of changing-look AGN and the secular evolution of XRBs. Finally, our MAD winds have terminal velocities and mass loss rates in good agreement with the properties of ultra-fast outflows observed in AGN.},

We study the critical parameters where the KNS shadow opens a gap, a distinctive phenomenon that does not happen with the black hole shadow. We show that the KNS shadow can only be closed for dimensionless spin \$a {\textbackslash}lesssim 1.18\$ and vanishing for \$a {\textbackslash}gtrsim 1.18\$ for certain ranges of inclination angles. We also perform numerical general relativistic ray tracing calculations, which reproduce the analytical topological change in the KNS shadow and illustrate other observational features within the shadow due to the lack of an event horizon. By comparing with black hole shadow observations, the topological change in the shadow of KNSs can be used to test the cosmic censorship hypothesis and KNSs as alternative models to SMBHs.},

	abstract = {The basic uniﬁed model of active galactic nuclei (AGNs) invokes an anisotropic obscuring structure, usually referred to as a torus, to explain AGN obscuration as an angle-dependent effect. We present a new grid of X-ray spectral templates based on radiative transfer calculations in neutral gas in an approximately toroidal geometry, appropriate for CCD-resolution X-ray spectra (FWHM  130 eV). Fitting the templates to broadband X-ray spectra of AGNs provides constraints on two important geometrical parameters of the gas distribution around the supermassive black hole: the average column density and the covering factor. Compared to the currently available spectral templates, our model is more ﬂexible, and capable of providing constraints on the main torus parameters in a wider range of AGNs. We demonstrate the application of this model using hard X-ray spectra from NuSTAR (3–79 keV) for four AGNs covering a variety of classiﬁcations: 3C 390.3, NGC 2110, IC 5063, and NGC 7582. This small set of examples was chosen to illustrate the range of possible torus conﬁgurations, from disk-like to sphere-like geometries with column densities below, as well as above, the Compton-thick threshold. This diversity of torus properties challenges the simple assumption of a standard geometrically and optically thick toroidal structure commonly invoked in the basic form of the uniﬁed model of AGNs. Finding broad consistency between our constraints and those from infrared modeling, we discuss how the approach from the X-ray band complements similar measurements of AGN structures at other wavelengths.},

We also compare the lines with those from thin accretion disks. Our calculations show that lines from tori and lines from thin disks share several common features. In particular, at low and moderate viewing inclination angles they both have asymmetric double-peaked profiles with a tall, sharp blue peak and a shorter red peak which has an extensive red wing. At high viewing inclination angles they both have very broad, asymmetric lines which can be roughly considered as single-peaked. Torus and disk lines may show very different red and blue line wings, but the differences are due to the models for relativistic tori and disks having differing inner boundary radii. Self-eclipse and lensing play some role in shaping the torus lines, but they are effective only at high inclination angles. If inner and outer radii of an accretion torus are the same as those of an accretion disk, their line profiles show substantial differences only when inclination angles are close to 90°, and those differences manifest mostly at the central regions of the lines instead of the wings.},

We use the vertically averaged magnetic stress in the simulated disc as a proxy for the rest-frame dissipation, and compute the observed emission by folding this through the transfer function describing the relativistic beaming, light bending and time delays near a non-rotating black hole. The temporal power spectrum of the predicted emission from individual annuli in the disc is described by a broken power law, with indices of ≈ −3.5 at high frequency and ≈0 to −1 at low frequency. Integrated over the disc, the power spectrum is approximated by a single power law with an index of −2. Increasing inclination boosts the relative power at frequencies around ≈0.3 f ms, where f ms is the orbital frequency at the marginally stable orbit, but no evidence is found for sharp quasi-periodic oscillations in the light curve. Assuming that ﬂuorescent iron line emission locally tracks the continuum ﬂux, we compute simulated broad iron line proﬁles. We ﬁnd that relativistic beaming of the non-axisymmetric emission proﬁle, induced by turbulence, produces high-amplitude variability in the iron line proﬁle. We show that this substructure within the broad iron line proﬁle can survive averaging over a number of orbital periods, and discuss the origin of the anomalous X-ray spectral features, recently reported by Turner et al. for the Seyfert galaxy NGC 3516, in the context of turbulent disc models.},

	abstract = {The objectives of this paper are twofold: (1) to present a new method of approximation such that the function and some of its derivatives are simultaneously approximated; and (2) to investigate the potential applications of this new method in the field of satellite geodesy by deriving a numerical solver of ordinary differential equations. To fulfill both the objectives, Sobolev polynomials are used. Explicit formulas for these polynomials are presented. A quadrature rule is derived based on the explicit forms of these polynomials. Solution of first order ordinary differential equations is presented based on the numerical integration method by the new quadrature rule. To present the applications of the results, three problems are investigated in the field of satellite geodesy. In the first application, orbit propagated by the numerical solution of orbital equations is compared with the Keplerian motion. It is shown that the new method for solving ordinary differential equations can be used alongside any other method, including the adaptive Runge-Kutta and Adams-Bashforth-Moulton integration methods. The comparison of this new method with the adaptive Runge-Kutta, Adams-Bashforth-Moulton, and the powerful and newly established adaptive Gaussian numerical integration methods reveals that it is at least 580, 666667, and 72 times more accurate than the mentioned methods, respectively, in any given absolute tolerance and time increment. The method is fast, stable, consistent, and capable of handling high accuracy, even with large time increment and low absolute tolerance, which is shown in this application. In the second application, the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) satellites' orbits are propagated using both the Ensemble Kalman Filter (EnKF) with stochastic updates and smoothing for the position and the Sobolev numerical integration. The orbits are then compared with the observed positions of the satellites. It is shown that the Sobolev polynomials work better in this problem, being more than 2 times more accurate. In the third application, the precision orbit determination problem for the Low Earth Orbit (LEO) CubeSats is investigated in the reduced dynamic form. A case study is presented for a pico-nano CubeSat in China. It is shown that the reduced dynamic orbit is approximately 32 percent more accurate than either of the kinematic or static Precise Point Positioning (PPP),representing a maximum error of 3.4 cm, with respect to the observation of the ground tracking stations.},

	abstract = {Stellar-mass black hole binary systems show a strong quasi-periodic oscillation (QPO) in their Comptonised emission. The frequency of this feature correlates with the ratio of a disc to Comptonised emission. We build a new energy-conserving model of the accretion flow, SSsed, which is based on the previous agnsed with complex Comptonisation. However, it is tuned to suit for stellar black holes by including a colour temperature correction, and allowing a little more freedom in the potential to compensate for uncertainties in relativistic correction depending on the corona shape. The model is applied to hundreds of RXTE data of a black hole binary XTE J1550-564. It constrains the model parameters of the innermost radii of the accretion flow, Rin, the outer radius of a hot inner flow which extends from Rin-Rhot and the outer radius of the softer (probably nonthermal) Comptonisation region extending from Rhot-Rcor. We showed that the outer radius of the combined Comptonised emission regions, Rcor anti-correlates well with the central frequencies of low-frequency QPOs detected during the same observations. The relation is remarkably consistent with the quantitative predictions of Lense-Thirring precession of the entire Comptonisation regions for the assumed system parameters. This strongly supports the scenario that low-frequency QPOs are caused by Lense-Thirring precession.},

Often real-world data sets are predominately composed of “normal” examples with only a small percentage of “abnormal” or “interesting” examples. It is also the case that the cost of misclassifying an abnormal (interesting) example as a normal example is often much higher than the cost of the reverse error. Under-sampling of the majority (normal) class has been proposed as a good means of increasing the sensitivity of a classiﬁer to the minority class. This paper shows that a combination of our method of over-sampling the minority (abnormal) class and under-sampling the majority (normal) class can achieve better classiﬁer performance (in ROC space) than only under-sampling the majority class. This paper also shows that a combination of our method of over-sampling the minority class and under-sampling the majority class can achieve better classiﬁer performance (in ROC space) than varying the loss ratios in Ripper or class priors in Naive Bayes. Our method of over-sampling the minority class involves creating synthetic minority class examples. Experiments are performed using C4.5, Ripper and a Naive Bayes classiﬁer.

	abstract = {The recent advent of the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) has made direct imaging of supermassive black holes a reality. Simulated images of black holes produced via general relativistic ray tracing and radiative transfer provide a key counterpart to these observational efforts. Black hole images have a wide range of physically interesting image structures, ranging from extremely fine scales in their lensed “photon rings” to the very large scales in their relativistic jets. The multiscale nature of the black hole system is therefore suitable for a multiscale approach to generate simulated images that capture all key elements of the system. Here, we present a prescription for adaptive ray tracing, which enables efficient computation of extremely high-resolution images of black holes. Using the polarized ray-tracing code ipole, we image a combination of semianalytic and general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic (GRMHD) models, and we show that images can be reproduced with a mean squared error of less than 0.1\% even after tracing 12× fewer rays. We then use adaptive ray tracing to explore the properties of the photon ring. We illustrate the behavior of individual subrings in GRMHD simulations, and we explore their signatures in interferometric visibilities.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/2205.13006},
	abstract = {During the final stages of black hole evaporation, ultraviolet deviations from General Relativity eventually become dramatic, potentially affecting the end-state. We explore this problem by performing nonlinear simulations of wave packets in Einstein-dilaton-Gauss-Bonnet gravity, the only gravity theory with quadratic curvature terms which can be studied at fully nonperturbative level. Black holes in this theory have a minimum mass but also a nonvanishing temperature. This poses a puzzle concerning the final fate of Hawking evaporation in the presence of high-curvature nonperturbative effects. By simulating the mass loss induced by evaporation at the classical level using an auxiliary phantom field, we study the nonlinear evolution of black holes past the minimum mass. We observe a runaway shrink of the horizon (a nonperturbative effect forbidden in General Relativity) which eventually unveils a high-curvature elliptic region. While this might hint to the formation of a naked singularity (and hence to a violation of the weak cosmic censorship) or of a pathological spacetime region, a different numerical formulation of the initial-value problem in this theory might be required to rule out other possibilities, including the transition from the critical black hole to a stable horizonless remnant. Our study is relevant in the context of the information-loss paradox, dark-matter remnants, and for constraints on microscopic primordial black holes.},

	abstract = {As the only gravity theory with quadratic curvature terms and second-order field equations, Einstein-dilaton-Gauss-Bonnet gravity is a natural testbed to probe the high-curvature regime beyond General Relativity in a fully nonperturbative way. Due to nonperturbative effects of the dilatonic coupling, black holes in this theory have a minimum mass which separates a stable branch from an unstable one. The minimum mass solution is a double point in the phase diagram of the theory, wherein the critical black hole and a wormhole solution coexist. We perform extensive nonlinear simulations of the spherical collapse onto black holes with scalar hair in this theory, especially focusing on the region near the minimum mass. We study the nonlinear transition from the unstable to the stable branch and assess the nonlinear stability of the latter. Furthermore, motivated by modeling the mass loss induced by Hawking radiation near the minimum mass at the classical level, we study the collapse of a phantom field onto the black hole. When the black-hole mass decreases past the critical value, the apparent horizon shrinks significantly, eventually unveiling a high-curvature elliptic region. We argue that evaporation in this theory is bound to either violate the weak cosmic censorship or produce horizonless remnants. Addressing the end-state might require a different evolution scheme.},

	abstract = {We estimate the canonical entropy of a quantum black hole by counting its quasi-normal modes. We first show that the partition function of a classical black hole, evaluated by counting the quasi-normal modes with a thermodyanmic Boltzmann weight, leads to a small entropy of order unity due to the small contribution from higher angular modes. We then discuss how this will be modified when taking into account dissipation effects near the horizon due to interaction with the quantum black hole microstates. The structure of quasi-normal modes drastically changes, yielding a fundamental frequency of the inverse of \$t\_\{{\textbackslash}rm echo\} {\textbackslash}sim\$ log(Entropy)/Temperature. This is the time-scale for reflection from the microstates (or the quantum time limit of silence, followed by echoes), \${\textbackslash}textit\{independent of the strength of dissipation\}\$, and is comparable to the scrambling time proposed by Sekino \& Susskind. Setting the dissipation constant to Planck time, we reproduce the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy of \${\textbackslash}sim\$ (Horizon area)/(Planck area). This result suggests the possibility of simulating black hole entropy in analog horizons realized in condensed matter systems.},

	abstract = {We present an improved version of the nested sampling algorithm nessai in which the core algorithm is modiﬁed to use importance weights. In the modiﬁed algorithm, samples are drawn from a mixture of normalising ﬂows and the requirement for samples to be independently and identically distributed (i.i.d.) according to the prior is relaxed. Furthermore, it allows for samples to be added in any order, independently of a likelihood constraint, and for the evidence to be updated with batches of samples. We call the modiﬁed algorithm i-nessai. We ﬁrst validate i-nessai using analytic likelihoods with known Bayesian evidences and show that the evidence estimates are unbiased in up to 32 dimensions. We compare i-nessai to standard nessai for the analytic likelihoods and the Rosenbrock likelihood, the results show that i-nessai is consistent with nessai whilst producing more precise evidence estimates. We then test i-nessai on 64 simulated gravitational-wave signals from binary black hole coalescence and show that it produces unbiased estimates of the parameters. We compare our results to those obtained using standard nessai and dynesty and ﬁnd that i-nessai requires 2.64 and 12.96 times fewer likelihood evaluations to converge, respectively. We also test i-nessai of an 80-second simulated binary neutron star signal using a Reduced-Order-Quadrature (ROQ) basis and ﬁnd that, on average, it converges in 33 minutes, whilst only requiring 1.05 × 106 likelihood evaluations compared to 1.42 × 106 for nessai and 4.30 × 107 for dynesty. These results demonstrate that i-nessai is consistent with nessai and dynesty whilst also being more eﬃcient.},

The main effect of the returning radiation is to increase the irradiating flux on to the outer parts of the accretion disc, leading to stronger reflection and a flatter overall emissivity profile. By analysing simulated observations we show that neglecting returning radiation in existing studies of reflection-dominated sources has likely resulted in overestimating the height of the corona above the black hole.

Most applications of variational inference employ simple families of posterior approximations in order to allow for efficient inference, focusing on mean-field or other simple structured approximations. This restriction has a significant impact on the quality of inferences made using variational methods. We introduce a new approach for specifying flexible, arbitrarily complex and scalable approximate posterior distributions. Our approximations are distributions constructed through a normalizing flow, whereby a simple initial density is transformed into a more complex one by applying a sequence of invertible transformations until a desired level of complexity is attained. We use this view of normalizing flows to develop categories of finite and infinitesimal flows and provide a unified view of approaches for constructing rich posterior approximations. We demonstrate that the theoretical advantages of having posteriors that better match the true posterior, combined with the scalability of amortized variational approaches, provides a clear improvement in performance and applicability of variational inference.},

The absorption lines in IRAS13224-3809 are best seen when the ﬂux is low and the reﬂection component of the disk is strong relative to the power-law continuum. The spectra are consistent with a model in which the reﬂection component passes through a thin, highly-ionized absorbing layer at the surface of the inner disc, the blue-shifted side of which dominates the ﬂux due to relativistic aberration (the disc inclination is about 70 deg).

	abstract = {We report strong and rapid X-ray variability found from the super-Eddington accreting quasar SDSS J081456.10+532533.5 at z = 0.1197. It has a black-hole mass of 2.7 × 107M⊙ and a dimensionless accretion rate of ≈ 4 measured from reverberation-mapping observations. It showed weak X-ray emission in the 2021 February Chandra observation, with the 2 keV ﬂux density being 9.6+−141.6.6 times lower compared to an archival Swift observation. The 2 keV ﬂux density is also 11.7+−96..63 times weaker compared to the expectation from its optical/UV emission. In a follow-up XMM-Newton observation 32 days later, the 2 keV ﬂux density increased by a factor of 5.3+−62..44, and the spectra are best described by a power law modiﬁed with partial-covering absorption; the absorption-corrected intrinsic continuum is at a nominal ﬂux level. Nearly simultaneous optical spectra reveal no variability, and there is only mild long-term optical/infrared variability from archival data (with a maximum variability amplitude of ≈ 50\%). We interpret the X-ray variability with an obscuration scenario, where the intrinsic X-ray continuum does not vary but the absorber has variable column density and covering factor along the line of sight. The absorber is likely the small-scale clumpy accretion wind that has been proposed to be responsible for similar X-ray variability in other super-Eddington accreting quasars.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.07463},
	abstract = {The soft X-ray excess in the spectra of active galactic nuclei is characterized by similar electron temperatures of 0.1 – 0.3 keV and similar photon indices around 2.2 – 3. It remains a puzzle why both values are not sensitive to the black hole mass nor accretion rate. Supposing that the scattering-dominated surface layer of an accretion disk can act as a warm corona, we construct a vertically one-zone model to understand what determines its temperature. By solving the equations of (1) the condition for the effective optical depth, (2) the energy balance, and (3) dominance of the Compton cooling over the bound-free cooling, we could reproduce the basic observational features of the soft excess, provided that anomalous heating takes place in the warm corona. The similar temperatures can be understood, since both of the anomalous heating and Compton cooling rates are proportional to the dissipation rate of the accretion energy, while similar photon indices are a natural consequence of the fact that observed photons are ﬁnally emitted from the layer of Compton y ∼ 1. The warm corona solutions only exist at smaller radii, indicating the structure of a warm corona inside and a hot corona outside. The soft excess is not observed in black hole binaries, since disk temperatures are too high for the Compton scattering to work as cooling. The derived temperatures are somewhat underestimation, however. This may indicate a necessity of multi-zone corona structure. The stability of the warm corona and its consequences are brieﬂy discussed.},

	abstract = {Cyg X-1 is probably the most studied and best understood black-hole X-ray binary. Recently, its accretion geometry has been probed with the X-ray polarization. The position angle of the X-ray emitting flow was found to be aligned with the position angle of the radio jet in the plane of the sky. At the same time, the observed high polarization degree could be obtained only for a high inclination of the X-ray emitting flow, indicating a misalignment between the binary axis and the black hole spin. The jet, in turn, is believed to be directed by the spin axis, hence similar misalignment is expected between the jet and binary axes. We test this hypothesis using very long (up to about 26 years) multi-band radio observations. We find the misalignment of \$20{\textasciicircum}{\textbackslash}circ\$-\$30{\textasciicircum}{\textbackslash}circ\$; however, on the contrary to the earlier expectations, the misalignment lies in the plane of the sky and not along the line of sight. Furthermore, the presence of the misalignment questions our understanding of the evolution of this binary system.},

To perform more self-consistent calculations of energy spectra of extended coronae, we develop monk, a Monte Carlo radiative transfer code dedicated to calculations of Comptonised spectra in the Kerr spacetime. In monk we assume Klein-Nishina scattering cross section and include all general relativistic effects. We find that for a corona located above the disc, the spectrum is not isotropic, but with harder and less luminous spectra towards observers at lower inclinations, owing to anisotropic illumination of the seed photons. This anisotropy also leads to an underestimated size of the corona if we assume the corona to be a point-like, isotropic source located on the black hole rotation axis, demonstrating the necessity of more self-consistent calculations. We also inspect the effect of motion and geometry of the corona on the emergent spectrum. Finally, we discuss the implication of anisotropic corona emission for the reflection spectrum in AGNs as well as black hole X-ray binaries (BHXRBs). We find that by assuming the corona emission to be isotropic, one may underestimate the soft excess in AGNs and the reflection continuum and iron K fluorescent line flux in BHXRBs.},

Theoretical emissivity profiles due to isotropic point sources as well as simple extended geometries are computed in general relativistic ray-tracing simulations performed on graphics processing units (GPUs). Such simulations assuming only general relativity naturally explain the accretion disc emissivity profiles determined from relativistically broadened emission lines which fall off steeply (with power-law indices of between 6 and 8) over the inner regions of the disc, then flattening off to almost a constant before tending to a constant power law of index 3 over the outer disc. Simulations for a variety of source locations, extents and geometries show how the emissivity profiles depend on these properties, and when combined with reverberation time lags allow the location and extent of the primary X-ray source to be constrained. Comparing the emissivity profile determined from the broadened iron K emission line in spectra of 1H 0707−495 obtained in 2008 January to theoretical emissivity profiles and applying constraints from reverberation lags suggest that there exists an extended region of primary X-ray emission located as low as 2rg above the accretion disc, extending outwards to a radius of around 30rg.},

This will depend on factors including the location and geometry of the X-ray source and the disc characteristics. We directly obtain the emissivity profile of the disc from the observed spectrum by considering the reflection component as the sum of contributions from successive radii in the disc and fitting to find the relative weightings of these components in a relativistically broadened emission line. This method has successfully recovered known emissivity profiles from synthetic spectra and is applied to XMM–Newton spectra of the Narrow Line Seyfert 1 galaxy 1H 0707-495. The data imply a twice-broken power-law form of the emissivity law with a steep profile in the inner regions of the disc (index 7.8) and then a flat region between 5.6 and 34.8rg before tending to a constant index of 3.3 over the outer regions of the disc. The form of the observed emissivity profile is consistent with theoretical predictions, thus reinforcing the reflection interpretation.},

The differences in the emissivity profiles produced by various corona geometries are explored via general relativistic ray tracing simulations. Through the analysis of various parameters of the geometries simulated it is found that emissivity profiles produced by point source and extended geometries such as cylindrical slabs and spheroidal coronae placed on the accretion disc are distinguishable. Profiles produced by point source and conical geometries are not significantly different, requiring an analysis of reflection fraction to differentiate the two geometries. Beamed point and beamed conical sources are also simulated in an effort to model jet-like coronae, though the differences here are most evident in the reflection fraction. For a point source we determine an approximation for the measured reflection fraction with the source height and velocity. Simulating spectra from the emissivity profiles produced by the various geometries produce distinguishable differences. Overall spectral differences between the geometries do not exceed 15 per cent in the most extreme cases. It is found that emissivity profiles can be useful in distinguishing point source and extended geometries given high-quality spectral data of extreme, bright sources over long exposure times. In combination with reflection fraction, timing and spectral analysis we may use emissivity profiles to discern the geometry of the X-ray source.},

Evolution under gravitational radiation losses reduces the separation and eccentricity. I note that below a critical eccentricity ecrit ≃ 0.97, the accretion disc’s viscous timescale at pericentre passage is probably longer than the orbital period P , and periodic eruptive behaviour is no longer possible. These QPE descendant systems (QPEDs) are then likely to produce quasiperiodic oscillations (QPOs) rather than eruptions, varying more smoothly over the orbital cycle, with duty cycles ∼ 1. I identify 2XMM J123103.2+110648 (P ≃ 3.9 hr) and (more tentatively) RE J1034+396 (P ≃ 1 hr) as candidate systems of this type, and ﬁnd agreement with their deduced eccentricities e {\textless} ecrit. The absence of eruptions and the lower accretion luminosities resulting from the smaller gravitational radiation losses may make QPED systems harder to discover. Ultimately they must evolve to have viscous times much longer than the orbital period, and either remain steady, or possibly have infrequent but large outbursts. The latter systems would be massive analogues of the soft X–ray transients produced by low stellar–mass X–ray binaries.},

	abstract = {Extreme tidal disruption events (eTDEs), which occur when a star passes very close to a supermassive black hole, may provide a way to observe a long-sought general relativistic eﬀect: orbits that wind several times around a black hole and then leave. Through general relativistic hydrodynamics simulations, we show that such eTDEs are easily distinguished from most tidal disruptions, in which stars come close, but not so close, to the black hole. Following the stellar orbit, the debris in eTDEs is initially distributed in a crescent that quickly turns into tight spirals, from which some mass later falls back toward the black hole, while the remainder is ejected. Internal shocks within the infalling debris power the observed emission. The resulting light-curve rises rapidly to roughly the Eddington luminosity, maintains this level for between a few weeks and a year (depending on both the stellar mass and the black hole mass), and then drops. Most of its power is in thermal X-rays at a temperature ∼ 106 K (∼ 100 eV). The debris evolution and observational features of eTDEs are qualitatively diﬀerent from ordinary TDEs, making eTDEs a new type of TDE. Although eTDEs are relatively rare for lower-mass black holes, most tidal disruptions around higher-mass black holes are extreme. Their detection oﬀers a view of an exotic relativistic phenomenon previously inaccessible.},

Being able to directly detect the presence of the ISCO and probe the dynamics of material plunging through the event horizon represents a unique test of general relativity in the strong field regime. X-ray reverberation off of the accretion disc and material in the plunging region is modelled using general relativistic ray tracing simulations. X-ray reverberation from the plunging region has a minimal effect on the time-averaged X-ray spectrum and the overall lag-energy spectrum, but is manifested in the lag in the highest frequency Fourier components, above \$0.01{\textbackslash}, c{\textasciicircum}\{3\}{\textbackslash}, (GM){\textasciicircum}\{-1\}\$ (scaled for the mass of the black hole) in the 2-4 keV energy band for a non-spinning black hole or the 1-2 keV energy band for a maximally spinning black hole. The plunging region is distinguished from disc emission not just by the energy shifts characteristic of plunging orbits, but by the rapid increase in ionization of material through the plunging region. Detection requires measurement of time lags to an accuracy of 20 per cent at these frequencies. Improving accuracy to 12 per cent will enable constraints to be placed on the dynamics of material in the plunging region and distinguish plunging orbits from material remaining on stable circular orbits, confirming the existence of the ISCO, a prime discovery space for future X-ray missions.},

	abstract = {Multi-wavelength observations suggest that the accretion disk in the hard and intermediate states of X-ray binaries (XRBs) and active galactic nuclei (AGN) transitions from a cold, thin disk at large distances into a hot, thick flow close to the black hole. However, the formation, structure and dynamics of such truncated disks are poorly constrained due to the complexity of the thermodynamic, magnetic, and radiative processes involved. We present the first radiation-transport two-temperature general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic (GRMHD) simulations of truncated disks radiating at 35\% of the Eddington luminosity with and without large-scale poloidal magnetic flux. We demonstrate that when a geometrically-thin accretion disk is threaded by large-scale net poloidal magnetic flux, it self-consistently transitions at small radii into a two-phase medium of cold gas clumps floating through a hot, magnetically dominated corona. This transition occurs at a well-defined truncation radius determined by the distance out to which the disk is saturated with magnetic flux. The average ion and electron temperatures in the semi-opaque corona reach, respectively, Ti=10{\textasciicircum}10 K and Te=5x10{\textasciicircum}8 K. The system produces radiation, powerful collimated jets and broader winds at the total energy efficiency exceeding 90\%, the highest ever energy extraction efficiency from a spinning black hole by a radiatively efficient flow in a GRMHD simulation. This is consistent with jetted ejections observed during XRB outbursts. The two-phase medium can naturally lead to broadened iron line emission observed in the hard state.},

The exact location of the matter in relation to the hard X-ray source is unclear, but the strength of the reflection spectrum is usually consistent with the hard X-rays being emitted above a flat accretion disc. In this paper we calculate reflection spectra for cases where the hard X-rays photoionize the surface layers of the disc to the extent that the main X- ray absorbers are significantly ionized. The temperature, ionization state and spectrum are computed in a fully self-consistent manner for the inner, radiation pressure dominated part of an accretion disc. The effects of photoionization are important typically when the accretion rate exceeds 10 per cent of the Eddington value. The reflection spectra are then steeper than the incident continuum in the soft X-ray band and are rich in emission lines which may prove to be good diagnostics of the conditions of the inner regions around accreting black holes. Reflection spectra from sources around stellar-mass black holes are also presented. The weak iron emission-line characteristic of these objects is explained.},

	abstract = {NGC 7582 (𝑧 = 0.005264; 𝐷 = 22.5 Mpc) is a highly variable, changing-look AGN. In this work, we explore the X-ray properties of this source using XMM-Newton and NuSTAR archival observations in the 3-40 keV range, from 2001 to 2016. NGC 7582 exhibits a long-term variability between observations but also a short-term variability in two observations that has not been studied before. To study the variability, we perform a time-resolved spectral analysis using a phenomenological model and a physically-motivated model (uxclumpy). The spectral ﬁtting is achieved using a nested sampling Monte Carlo method. uxclumpy enables testing various geometries of the absorber that may ﬁt AGN spectra. We ﬁnd that the best model is composed of a fully covering clumpy absorber. From this geometry, we estimate the velocity, size and distance of the clumps. The column density of the absorber in the line of sight varies from Compton-thin to Compton-thick between observations. Variability over the timescale of a few tens of kilo-seconds is also observed within two observations. The obscuring clouds are consistent with being located at a distance not larger than 0.6 pc, moving with a transverse velocity exceeding ∼ 700 km s−1. We could put only a lower limit on the size of the obscuring cloud being larger than 1013 cm. Given the sparsity of the observations, and the limited exposure time per observation available, we cannot determine the exact structure of the obscuring clouds. The results are broadly consistent with comet-like obscuring clouds or spherical clouds with a non-uniform density proﬁle.},

The high-quality data of these spectra had previously led to precise black hole spin measurements and very stringent constraints on possible deviations from the Kerr metric. We find that the disk thickness does not change previous spin results found with a model employing an infinitesimally thin disk, which confirms the robustness of spin measurements in high radiative efficiency disks, where the impact of disk thickness is minimal. Similar analysis on lower accretion rate systems will be an important test for measuring the effect of disk thickness on black hole spin measurements.},

	abstract = {Modern X-ray telescopes have detected hundreds of thousands of X-ray sources in the universe. However, current methods to classify these sources using the X-ray data themselves suﬀer problems —detailed X-ray spectroscopy of individual sources is too time-consuming, while hardness ratios often lack accuracy, and can be diﬃcult to use eﬀectively. These methods fail to use the power of X-ray CCD detectors to identify X-ray emission lines and distinguish line-dominated spectra (from chromospherically active stars, supernova remnants etc.) from continuum-dominated ones (e.g. compact objects or active galactic nuclei [AGN]). In this paper, we probe the use of artiﬁcial neural networks (ANN) in diﬀerentiating Chandra spectra of young stars in the Chandra Orion Ultradeep Project (COUP) survey from AGN in the Chandra Deep Field South (CDFS) survey. We use these surveys to generate 100,000 artiﬁcial spectra of stars and AGN, and train our ANN models to separate the two kinds of spectra. We ﬁnd that our methods reach an accuracy of ∼ 92\% in classifying simulated spectra of moderatebrightness objects in typical exposures, but their performance decreases on the observed COUP and CDFS spectra (∼ 91\%), due in large part to the relatively high background of these long-exposure datasets. We also investigate the performance of our methods with changing properties of the spectra such as the net source counts, the relative contribution of background, the absorption column of the sources, etc. We conclude that these methods have substantial promise for application to large X-ray surveys.},

	abstract = {Roughly half of the quasi-periodic eruption (QPE) sources in galactic nuclei exhibit a remarkably regular alternating “long-short” pattern of recurrence times between consecutive ﬂares. In support of previous suggestions, we show that a main-sequence star (brought into the nucleus as an extreme mass-ratio inspiral; EMRI) which passes twice per orbit through the accretion disk of the supermassive black hole (SMBH) on a mildly eccentric inclined orbit, each time shocking and ejecting optically-thick gas clouds above and below the midplane (akin to dual miniature “supernovae”), naturally reproduces the luminosities, durations, and spectral temperatures of observed QPE ﬂares. Similar to supernova shock break-out from a compact star, ineﬃcient photon production in the collision debris renders the QPE emission much harder than the blackbody temperature, enabling the Comptonized spectrum to stick out from the softer quiescent disk spectrum. Destruction of the star via mass ablation typically limits the lifetime of the QPE emission to decades, precluding a long-lived AGN as the source of the gaseous disk. By contrast, a tidal disruption event (TDE) naturally provides a transient gaseous disk on the requisite radial scale, with a rate suﬃciently high relative to the EMRI inward migration rate, that a signiﬁcant fraction of TDEs should host a QPE. This picture is consistent with the X-ray TDE observed several years prior to the QPE emission from GSN 069. Remarkably, a second TDElike ﬂare was observed from this event, starting immediately after detectable QPE activity ceased; this accretion event could plausibly result from the (partial or complete) destruction of the QPE-generating star triggered by runaway mass-loss, though other explanations cannot be excluded. Our model can also be applied to black hole-disk collisions, such as those proposed to generate quasi-periodic ﬂares in the candidate SMBH binary OJ 287.},

	abstract = {X-ray quasi-periodic eruptions (QPEs) represent a recently discovered example of extreme X-ray variability associated with supermassive black holes. Those are high amplitude bursts recurring every few hours and detected in the soft X-ray band from the nuclei of nearby galaxies whose optical spectra lack the broad emission lines typically observed in unobscured active galaxies. The physical origin of this new X-ray variability phenomenon is still unknown, and several theoretical models have been presented. However, no attempt has been made so far to account for the varying QPE recurrence time and luminosity in individual sources, nor for the diversity of the QPE phenomenology in the diﬀerent known erupters. We present a semi-analytical model based on an Extreme Mass Ratio Inspiral (EMRI) system where the secondary intersects, along its orbit, a rigidly precessing accretion disc surrounding the primary. We assume QPEs to be due to emission from an adiabatically expanding, initially optically thick gas cloud expelled from the disc plane at each impact. We produce synthetic X-ray light curves that are compared with X-ray data from four QPE sources: GSN 069, eRO-QPE1, eRO-QPE2 and RX J1301.9+2747. Our model reproduces the diversity of QPE properties between the considered objects well, and is also able to account naturally for the varying QPE amplitudes and recurrence times in individual sources. Future implementations will enable us to reﬁne the match with the data, and to estimate precisely the system parameters making also use of multi-epoch QPE data. We brieﬂy discuss the nature of the secondary object as well as possible implications of our ﬁndings for the EMRI population at large.},

Results. We show that magnetic heating is strong enough to heat upper layers of the accretion disk atmosphere, which form the warm corona covering the disk. Magnetic pressure does not remove TI caused by radiative processes operating in X-ray emitting plasma. TI disappears only in case of accretion rates higher than 0.2 of Eddington, and high magnetic ﬁeld parameter αB {\textgreater} 0.1.
Conclusions. TI plays the major role in the formation of the warm corona above magnetically driven accretion disk in AGN. The warm, Compton cooled corona, responsible for soft X-ray excess, resulted from our model has typical temperature in the range of 0.01 - 2 keV and optical depth even up to 50, which agrees with recent observations.},

In this chapter we pedagogically review the basics behind pulsar observations and pulsar timing. We illustrate various recent strong-ﬁeld tests of the general relativity (GR) from the Hulse-Taylor pulsar PSR B1913+16, the double pulsar PSR J0737−3039, and the triple pulsar PSR J0337+1715. We also overview the inner structure of neutron stars (NSs) that may inﬂuence some gravity tests, and have used the scalar-tensor gravity and massive gravity theories as examples to demonstrate the usefulness of pulsar timing in constraining speciﬁc modiﬁed gravity theories. Outlooks to new radio telescopes for pulsar timing and synergies with other strong-ﬁeld gravity tests are also presented.},

The antics of this collaborator, hereafter "Conan O'Brien," were impeding the publication of an important manuscript. With my tenure date looming, I found myself desperate. Luckily, I study inference, a computational means to find a solution to a physical problem, based on available measurements (say, a dead body) and a dynamical model assumed to give rise to those measurements (a murderer). If the measurements are insufficient and/or the model is incomplete, one obtains multiple "degenerate" solutions to the problem. Degenerate solutions are all equally valid given the information available, and thus render meaningless the notion of one "correct" solution. Typically in scientific research, degeneracy is undesirable. Here I describe the opposite situation: a quest to create degenerate solutions in which to cloak myself. Or even better: to render measurements incompatible with a solution in which I am the murderer. Moreover, I show how one may sabotage an inference procedure to commit an untraceable crime. I sit here now, typing victoriously, a free woman. Because you won't believe me anyway. And even if you do, you'll never prove a thing.},

	abstract = {To gain a better understanding of the inner disc region that comprises active galactic nuclei, it is necessary to understand the pattern in which the disc is illuminated (the emissivity profile) by X-rays emitted from the continuum source above the black hole (corona). The differences in the emissivity profiles produced by various corona geometries are explored via general relativistic ray tracing simulations. Through the analysis of various parameters of the geometries simulated it is found that emissivity profiles produced by point source and extended geometries such as cylindrical slabs and spheroidal coronae placed on the accretion disc are distinguishable. Profiles produced by point source and conical geometries are not significantly different, requiring an analysis of reflection fraction to differentiate the two geometries. Beamed point and beamed conical sources are also simulated in an effort to model jet-like coronae, though the differences here are most evident in the reflection fraction. For a point source we determine an approximation for the measured reflection fraction with the source height and velocity. Simulating spectra from the emissivity profiles produced by the various geometries produce distinguishable differences. Overall spectral differences between the geometries do not exceed 15 per cent in the most extreme cases. It is found that emissivity profiles can be useful in distinguishing point source and extended geometries given high-quality spectral data of extreme, bright sources over long exposure times. In combination with reflection fraction, timing and spectral analysis we may use emissivity profiles to discern the geometry of the X-ray source.},

The absorption lines in IRAS 13224-3809 are best seen when the flux is low and the reflection component of the disc is strong relative to the power-law continuum. The spectra are consistent with a model in which the reflection component passes through a thin, highly ionized absorbing layer at the surface of the inner disc, the blueshifted side of which dominates the flux due to relativistic aberration (the disc inclination is about 70°).

Data observation in high-energy astrophysics is disrupted by celestial occlusions and limited telescope time while data derived from laboratory experiments in synthetic chemistry and materials science is time and cost-intensive to collect. On the other hand, knowledge about the data-generation mechanism is often available in the sciences, such as the measurement error of a piece of laboratory apparatus. Both characteristics, small data and knowledge of the underlying physics, make Gaussian processes (GPs) ideal candidates for fitting such datasets. GPs can make predictions with consideration of uncertainty, for example in the virtual screening of molecules and materials, and can also make inferences about incomplete data such as the latent emission signature from a black hole accretion disc. Furthermore, GPs are currently the workhorse model for Bayesian optimisation, a methodology foreseen to be a guide for laboratory experiments in scientific discovery campaigns. The first contribution of this thesis is to use GP modelling to reason about the latent emission signature from the Seyfert galaxy Markarian 335, and by extension, to reason about the applicability of various theoretical models of black hole accretion discs. The second contribution is to extend the GP framework to molecular and chemical reaction representations and to provide an open-source software library to enable the framework to be used by scientists. The third contribution is to leverage GPs to discover novel and performant photoswitch molecules. The fourth contribution is to introduce a Bayesian optimisation scheme capable of modelling aleatoric uncertainty to facilitate the identification of material compositions that possess intrinsic robustness to large scale fabrication processes.},

I will then explore recent work that looks at the nature of the primary X-ray source (i.e. the corona) in NLS1s, demonstrating how the corona can be compact, dynamic, and in some cases consistent with collimated outflow. X-ray observations of NLS1s will be key in determining the nature of the corona, resolving the disc-jet connection, and determining the origin of the radio loud/quiet dichotomy in AGN.},

To understand their orbital evolution through interactions with the disc gas, we perform a suite of 2D high-resolution, local shearing box, viscous hydrodynamical simulations of equal-mass binaries. We find that viscosity not only smooths the flow structure around prograde circular binaries, but also greatly raises their accretion rates. The overwhelming positive torque associated with the accretion dominates over the gravitational torque, and drives binary orbital expansion. However, retrograde binaries still experience rapid orbital decay, and prograde eccentric binaries still experience eccentricity damping, despite undergoing outspiral. Our numerical experiments further show that prograde binaries may experience inspiral if the physical sizes of the accretors are sufficiently small, such that the net binary accretion is reduced. Such a dependence of the binary accretion rate on the accretor size can be weaken through boosted accretion either due to a high viscosity or a more isothermal-like equation of state (EOS). Our results widen the explored parameter space for the hydrodynamics of embedded BBHs and demonstrate that their orbital evolution in AGN discs is a complex, multifaceted problem.},

Today X-ray reflection spectroscopy is a mature technique and a powerful tool for studying the accretion process around black holes, measuring black hole spins, and testing Einstein's theory of General Relativity in the strong field regime. However, current reflection models still rely on a number of simplifications and caution is necessary when we derive very precise measurements. In this paper, we study the impact of the returning radiation on our capability of measuring the properties of black holes using X-ray reflection spectroscopy, and in particular on our capability of testing the Kerr black hole hypothesis. While the returning radiation alters the reflection spectrum of the disk, from the analysis of our simulations we find that models without returning radiation can normally recover well the correct black hole spin parameters and can test the Kerr metric. Our study thus confirms that current tests of the Kerr hypothesis using X-ray reflection spectroscopy can be robust.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.12539},
	abstract = {Recent studies have shown that AGN discs can host sources of gravitational waves. Compact binaries can form and merge in AGN discs through their interactions with the gas and other compact objects in the disc. It is also possible for the binaries to shorten the merging timescale due to eccentricity excitation caused by perturbations from the supermassive blackhole (SMBH). In this paper we focus on eﬀects due to precession-induced (eviction-like) resonances, where nodal and apsidal precession rates of the binary is commensurable with the mean motion of the binary around the SMBH. We focus on intermediate mass black hole (IMBH)-stellar mass black hole (SBH) binaries, and consider binary orbit inclined from the circum-IMBH disk which leads to the orbital J2 precession. We show that if a binary is captured in these resonances and is migrating towards the companion, it can undergo large eccentricity and inclination variations. We derive analytical expressions for the location of ﬁxed points, libration timescale and width for these resonances, and identiﬁed two resonances in the near coplanar regime (the evection and eviction resonances) as well as two resonances in the near polar regime that can lead to mergers. We also derive analytical expressions for the maximum eccentricity that a migrating binary can achieve for given initial conditions. Speciﬁcally, the maximum eccentricity can reach 0.9 when captured in these resonances before orbital decay due to gravitational wave emission dominates, and the capture is only possible for slow migration (∼ 10 Myr) 2-3 order of magnitude longer than the resonance libration timescale. We also show that capture into multiple resonances is possible, and can further excite eccentricities.},

	abstract = {The analysis of light variation of M87 can help us understand the disc evolution. In the past decade, M87 has experienced several short-term light variabilities related to flares. We also find there are year-scale X-ray variations in the core of M87. Their light variability properties are similar to clumpy-ADAF. By re-analyzing 56 \${\textbackslash}it Chandra\$ observations from 2007 to 2019, we distinguish the `non-flaring state' from `flaring state' in the light variability. After removing flaring state data, we identify 4 gas clumps in the nucleus and all of them can be well fitted by the clumpy-ADAF model. The average mass accretion rate is \${\textbackslash}sim 0.16 {\textbackslash}rm M\_\{{\textbackslash}odot\} yr{\textasciicircum}\{-1\}\$. We analyze the photon index(\${\textbackslash}Gamma\$)-flux(2-10keV) correlation between the non-flaring state and flaring state. For the non-flaring states, the flux is inversely proportional to the photon index. For the flaring states, we find no obvious correlation between the two parameters. In addition, we find that the flare always occurs at a high mass accretion rate, and after the luminosity of the flare reaches the peak, it will be accompanied by a sudden decrease in luminosity. Our results can be explained as that the energy released by magnetic reconnection destroys the structure of the accretion disc, thus the luminosity decreases rapidly and returns to normal levels thereafter.},

	abstract = {The relative spin orientations of black holes (BHs) in binaries encode their evolutionary history: BHs assembled dynamically should have isotropically distributed spins, while spins of the BHs originating in the ﬁeld should be aligned with the orbital angular momentum. In this article, we introduce a simple population model for these dynamical and ﬁeld binaries that uses spin orientations as an anchor to disentangle these two evolutionary channels. We then analyze binary BH mergers in the Third Gravitational-Wave Transient Catalog (GWTC-3) and ask whether BHs from the isotropicspin population possess diﬀerent distributions of mass-ratio, spin magnitudes, or redshifts from the preferentially-aligned-spin population. We ﬁnd no compelling evidence that binary BHs in GWTC-3 have diﬀerent source-property distributions depending on their spin alignment, but we do ﬁnd that the dynamical and ﬁeld channels cannot both have mass-ratio distributions that strongly favor equal masses. We give an example of how this can be used to provide insights into the various processes that drive these BHs to merge. We also ﬁnd that the current detections are insuﬃcient in extracting diﬀerences in spin magnitude or redshift distributions of isotropic and aligned spin populations.},

For this purpose, we first compute numerically the Regge pole spectrum for various charge-to-mass ratio configurations. We then derive an asymptotic expressions for the lowest Regge poles, and by considering Bohr-Sommerfeld-type quantization conditions, obtain the spectrum of weakly damped quasinormal frequencies from the Regge trajectories. Next, we construct the scattering and conversion amplitudes as well as the total differential cross sections for different processes using both a complex angular momentum representation and a partial wave expansion method. Finally, we provide an analytical approximation of the scattering and conversion cross sections of different processes from asymptotic expressions for the lowest Regge poles and the associated residues based on the correspondence Regge poles, "surface waves" propagating close to the photon (graviton) sphere. This allows us to extract the physical interpretation encoded in the partial wave expansions in the high-frequency regime (i.e., in the short-wavelength regime), and to describe semiclassically with very good agreement both black hole glory and a large part of the orbiting oscillations, thus unifying these two phenomena from a purely wave point of view.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.12541},
	abstract = {We present an X-ray spectro-polarimetric analysis of the bright Seyfert galaxy NGC 4151. The source has been observed with the Imaging X-ray Polarimetry Explorer (IXPE) for 700 ks, complemented with simultaneous XMM-Newton (50 ks) and NuSTAR (100 ks) pointings. A polarization degree Π = 4.9 ± 1.1\% and angle Ψ = 86◦ ± 7◦ east of north (68\% conﬁdence level) are measured in the 2–8 keV energy range. The spectro-polarimetric analysis shows that the polarization could be entirely due to reﬂection. Given the low reﬂection ﬂux in the IXPE band, this requires however a reﬂection with a very large ({\textgreater} 38\%) polarization degree. Assuming more reasonable values, a polarization degree of the hot corona ranging from ∼ 4 to ∼ 8\% is found. The observed polarization degree excludes a ‘spherical’ lamppost geometry for the corona, suggesting instead a slab-like geometry, possibly a wedge, as determined via Monte Carlo simulations. This is further conﬁrmed by the X-ray polarization angle, which coincides with the direction of the extended radio emission in this source, supposed to match the disc axis. NGC 4151 is the ﬁrst AGN with an X-ray polarization measure for the corona, illustrating the capabilities of X-ray polarimetry and IXPE in unveiling its geometry.},

Static electric or magnetic charge can also alter the space time structure, similar to gravitational mass, giving rise to its effect on redshift. This can also be considered as electro and magneto static redshift. Gravitational redshift has been reported by most of the authors without consideration of static electric and/or magnetic charges present in the rotating body. In the present paper, we considered the three parameters: mass, rotation parameter and charge to discuss their combined effect on redshift, for a charged rotating body by using Kerr–Newman metric. It has been found that, the presence of electrostatic and magnetostatic charge increases the value of socalled gravitational redshift. Calculations have been also done here to determine the effect of electrostatic and magnetostatic charges on the amount of redshift of a light ray emitted at various latitudes from a charged rotating body. The variation of gravitational redshift from equatorial to non- equatorial region has been calculated, for a given set of values of electrostatic and magnetostatic charges.},

Particles experience Fermi-type acceleration up to ultra-high-energies, predominantly of the parallel velocity component to the local magnetic ﬁeld, in the reconnection layers in all scales due to the ideal electric ﬁelds of the background ﬂuctuations (V × B, where V and B are the velocity and magnetic ﬁeld of the ﬂuctuations, respectively). In this work, we show MHD-particlein-cell (MHD-PIC) simulations following the early stages of the particle acceleration in the relativistic jet which conﬁrm these previous results, demonstrating the strong potential of magnetic reconnection driven by turbulence to accelerate relativistic particles to extreme energies in magnetically dominated ﬂows. Our results also show that the dynamical time variations of the background magnetic ﬁelds do not inﬂuence the acceleration of the particles in this process.},

	abstract = {In this work, we perform a phenomenological derivation of the ﬁrst- and second-order relativistic hydrodynamics of dissipative ﬂuids. To set the stage, we start with a review of the ideal relativistic hydrodynamics from energy–momentum and particle number conservation equations. We then go on to discuss the matching conditions to local thermodynamical equilibrium, symmetries of the energy–momentum tensor, decomposition of dissipative processes according to their Lorentz structure, and, ﬁnally, the deﬁnition of the ﬂuid velocity in the Landau and Eckart frames. With this preparatory work, we ﬁrst formulate the ﬁrst-order (Navier–Stokes) relativistic hydrodynamics from the entropy ﬂow equation, keeping only the ﬁrst-order gradients of thermodynamical forces. A generalized form of diffusion terms is found with a matrix of diffusion coefﬁcients describing the relative diffusion between various ﬂavors. The procedure of ﬁnding the dissipative terms is then extended to the second order to obtain the most general form of dissipative function for multiﬂavor systems up to the second order in dissipative ﬂuxes. The dissipative function now includes in addition to the usual second-order transport coefﬁcients of Israel–Stewart theory also second-order diffusion between different ﬂavors. The relaxation-type equations of second-order hydrodynamics are found from the requirement of positivity of the dissipation function, which features the ﬁnite relaxation times of various dissipative processes that guarantee the causality and stability of the ﬂuid dynamics. These equations contain a complete set of nonlinear terms in the thermodynamic gradients and dissipative ﬂuxes arising from the entropy current, which are not present in the conventional Israel–Stewart theory.},

GR is based on the universality of gravity and Einstein's equivalence principle (EEP). However, EEP is not a basic principle of physics but an empirical fact. Non-Minimal Coupling (NMC) of electromagnetic fields violates EEP, and their effects manifest in the strong-gravity regime. Hence, EHT provides an opportunity to test NMC in the strong-gravity regime. We show that, to the leading order in the spin parameter, NMC of the electromagnetic field modifies the black hole image in two ways: First, for one polarization mode, the horizon casts a shadow of radius {\textbackslash}emph\{greater than\} \${\textbackslash}sqrt\{27\} GM/c{\textasciicircum}2\$ on the image of the source. For the other polarization mode, it is {\textbackslash}emph\{smaller than\} \${\textbackslash}sqrt\{27\} GM/c{\textasciicircum}2\$. Second, the brightness and the position of the lensing ring are affected by the non-minimal coupling. The lensing ring is more prominent for one polarization mode than the other. Finally, we discuss the constraints on the NMC constant from future ngEHT observations.},

The latter are obtained using a novel on-shell recursion relation for classical amplitudes with four scalars and an arbitrary number of gravitons. Our one-loop ﬁve-point amplitude is expressed in terms of a single family of master integrals with the principal value prescription for linearised massive propagators, which we evaluate using diﬀerential equations. In our HEFT approach, soft/heavy-mass expansions of complete integrands are avoided, and all hyper-classical iterations and quantum corrections are dropped at the diagrammatic level, thereby computing directly contributions to classical physics. Our result exhibits the expected factorisation of infrared divergences, the correct soft limits, and highly nontrivial cancellations of spurious poles.

	abstract = {Black hole accretion flows show rapid X-ray variability. The power spectral density (PSD) of this is typically fit by a phenomenological model of multiple Lorentzians for both the broad-band noise and quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs). Our previous paper developed the first physical model for the PSD and fit this to observational data. This was based on the same truncated disc/hot inner flow geometry which can explain the correlated properties of the energy spectra. This assumes that the broad-band noise is from propagating fluctuations in mass accretion rate within the hot flow, while the QPO is produced by global Lense-Thirring precession of the same hot flow. Here we develop this model, making some significant improvements. First, we specify that the viscous frequency (equivalently, surface density) in the hot flow has the same form as that measured from numerical simulations of precessing, tilted accretion flows. Secondly, we refine the statistical techniques which we use to fit the model to the data. We re-analyse the PSD from the 1998 rise to outburst of XTE J1550-564 with our new model in order to assess the impact of these changes. We find that the derived outer radii of the hot flow (set by the inner radius of the truncated disc) are rather similar, changing from ∼68 to 13Rg throughout the outburst rise. However, the more physical assumptions of our new model also allow us to constrain the scaleheight of the flow. This decreases as the outer radius of the flow decreases, as expected from the spectral evolution. The spectrum steepens in response to the increased cooling as the truncation radius sweeps in, so gas pressure support for the flow decreases. The new model, PROPFLUC, is publicly available within the XSPEC spectral fitting package.},

	abstract = {The clear characteristic time-scale picked out by the low-frequency quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs) seen in many black hole and neutron star binaries has the potential to provide a very powerful diagnostic of the inner regions of the accretion flow. However, this potential cannot be realized without a quantitative model for the QPO. We have recently shown that the same truncated disc/hot inner flow geometry which is used to interpret the spectral transitions can also directly produce the QPO from Lense-Thirring (vertical) precession of the hot inner flow. This correctly predicts both the frequency and spectrum of the QPO, and the tight correlation of these properties with the total spectrum of the source via a changing truncation radius between the disc and hot flow. This model predicts a unique iron line signature as a vertically tilted flow illuminates different azimuths of the disc as it precesses. The iron line arising from this rotating illumination is blueshifted when the flow irradiates the approaching region of the spinning disc and redshifted when the flow irradiates the receding region of the disc. This gives rise to a characteristic rocking of the iron line on the QPO frequency which is a necessary (and probably sufficient) test of a Lense-Thirring origin. This is also an independent test of disc truncation models for the low/hard state, as vertical precession cannot occur if there is a disc in the midplane. We show that it may be possible to observe this effect using archival data from the Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer or XMM-Newton. However, a clean test requires a combination of moderate resolution and good statistics, such as would be available from a long XMM-Newton observation or with data from the proposed European Space Agency mission Large Observatory for X-ray Timing.},

We start with particular attention to the definition of the shadow and its relation to the often used concepts of escape cone, critical impact parameter and particle cross-section. For methodological purposes, we present the derivation of the angular size of the shadow for an arbitrary spherically symmetric and static space-time, which allows one to calculate the shadow for an observer at arbitrary distance from the center. Then we discuss the calculation of the shadow of a Kerr black hole, for an observer anywhere outside of the black hole. For observers at large distances we present and compare two methods used in the literature. Special attention is given to calculating the shadow in space-times which are not asymptotically flat. Shadows of wormholes and other black-hole impostors are reviewed. Then we discuss the calculation of the black hole shadow in an expanding universe as seen by a comoving observer. The influence of a plasma on the shadow of a black hole is also considered.},

A novel machine learning method is developed to solve the general FP equations based on deep neural networks. The proposed algorithm does not require any interpolation and coordinate transformation, which is diﬀerent from the traditional numercial methods. The main novelty of this paper is that penalty factors are introduced to overcome the local optimization for the deep learning approach, and the corresponding setting rules are given. Meanwhile, we consider a normalization condition as a supervision condition to eﬀectively avoid that the trial solution is zero. Several numerical examples are presented to illustrate performances of the proposed algorithm, including one- and twodimensional systems. All the results suggest that the deep learning is quite feasible and eﬀective to calculate the FP equation. Further, inﬂuences of the number of hidden layers, the penalty factors, and the optimization algorithm are discussed in detail. These results indicate that the performances of the machine learning technique can be improved through constructing the neural networks appropriately.},

Our simulations demonstrate that, for a mildly relativistic, magnetized pair shock (Lorentz factor \${\textbackslash}gamma\_\{{\textbackslash}rm sh\} {\textbackslash}simeq 2.7\$, magnetization level \${\textbackslash}sigma {\textbackslash}simeq 0.01\$), strong turbulence can revive particle acceleration in a superluminal configuration that otherwise prohibits it. Depending on the initial plasma temperature and magnetization, stochastic-shock-drift or diffusive-type acceleration governs particle energization, producing powerlaw spectra \${\textbackslash}mathrm\{d\}N/{\textbackslash}mathrm\{d\}{\textbackslash}gamma {\textbackslash}propto {\textbackslash}gamma{\textasciicircum}\{-s\}\$ with \$s {\textbackslash}sim 2.5-3.5\$.

We used the data from InsightHXMT ME/HE, NICER and NuSTAR which cover the energy range between 0.8–210 keV. Coherent timing analysis of Insight-HXMT ME/HE and NICER data revealed a complex behavior at the early stage of the outburst, between MJD 59737.0-59741.9, and beyond between MJD 59741.9–59760.6 a signiﬁcant spin-up ν˙ of (9.0 ± 2.1) × 10−14 Hz s−1. We detected the X-ray pulsations up to ∼ 95 keV in a combination of Insight-HXMT HE observations. The pulse proﬁles were quite stable over the whole outburst and could be well described by a truncated Fourier series using two harmonics, the fundamental and the ﬁrst overtone. Both components kept alignment in the range 0.8–64 keV. The joint and time-averaged NICER and Insight-HXMT spectra in the energy range 1–150 keV were well ﬁtted by the absorbed Comptonization model compps plus disk blackbody with two additional Gaussian components. Based on the bolometric ﬂux during the spin-up epoch, we determined a magnetic ﬁeld strength of (0.23 − 1.11) × 108 G in MAXI J1816−195.},

	abstract = {Using Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) to solve a speciﬁc boundary value problem is becoming more popular as an alternative to traditional methods. However, depending on the speciﬁc problem, they could be computationally expensive and potentially less accurate. The functionality of PINNs for real-world physical problems can signiﬁcantly improve if they become more ﬂexible and adaptable. To address this, our work explores the idea of training a PINN for general boundary conditions and source terms expressed through a limited number of coeﬃcients, introduced as additional inputs in the network. Although this process increases the dimensionality and is computationally costly, using the trained network to evaluate new general solutions is much faster. Our results indicate that PINN solutions are relatively accurate, reliable, and well-behaved. We applied this idea to the astrophysical scenario of the magnetic ﬁeld evolution in the interior of a neutron star connected to a force-free magnetosphere. Solving this problem through a global simulation in the entire domain is expensive due to the elliptic solver’s needs for the exterior solution. The computational cost with a PINN was more than an order of magnitude lower than the similar case solved with classical methods. These results pave the way for the future extension to 3D of this (or a similar) problem, where generalised boundary conditions are very costly to implement.},

Such predictions are generated by general relativistic radiative transfer (GRRT) codes, which integrate the equations of polarized radiative transfer in curved spacetime. A selection of ray-tracing GRRT codes used within the EHT collaboration is evaluated for accuracy and consistency in producing a selection of test images, demonstrating that the various methods and implementations of radiative transfer calculations are highly consistent. When imaging an analytic accretion model, we ﬁnd that all codes produce images similar within a pixel-wise normalized mean squared error (NMSE) of 0.012 in the worst case. When imaging a snapshot from a cell-based magnetohydrodynamic simulation, we ﬁnd all test images to be similar within NMSEs of 0.02, 0.04, 0.04, and 0.12 in Stokes I, Q, U , and V respectively. We additionally ﬁnd the values of several image metrics relevant to published EHT results to be in agreement to much better precision than measurement uncertainties.},

	abstract = {Using a fast semi-analytic raytracing code, we study the variability of relativistically broadened Fe–Kα lines due to discoseismic oscillations concentrated in the innermost regions of accretion discs around black holes. The corrugation mode, or c-mode, is of particular interest as its natural frequency corresponds well to the ∼0.1–15 Hz range observed for low-frequency quasi-periodic oscillations (LFQPOs) for lower spins. Comparison of the oscillation phase dependent variability and quasi-periodic oscillation-phase stacked Fe–Kα line observations will allow such discoseismic models to be conﬁrmed or ruled out as a source of particular LFQPOs. The spectral range and frequency of the variability of the Fe–Kα line due to c-modes can also potentially be used to constrain the black hole spin if observed with sufﬁcient temporal and spectral resolution.},

We ﬁnd that 76\% of the observations in our sample require a disk density higher than the 1015 cm−3 assumed in the previous reﬂection analysis. Compared with the measurements from active galactic nuclei, stellar mass black holes have higher disk densities. Our ﬁts indicate that the inner disk radius is close to the innermost stable circular orbit in the hard state. The coronal temperatures are signiﬁcantly lower than the prediction of a purely thermal plasma, which can be explained with a hybrid plasma model. If the disk density is ﬁxed at 1015 cm−3, the disk ionization parameter would be overestimated while the inner disk radius is unaﬀected.},

We focus in particular on the discovery (and mystery) of strong X-ray emission from radio jets on kpc-scales, enabled by the unequaled high resolution of the Chandra X-ray observatory. We review the main evidence for and against the viable models to explain this X-ray emission over the last 20 years. Finally, we present results of a recent study on the X-ray variability of kpc-scale jets, where we ﬁnd evidence that between 30-100\% of the X-ray jet population is variable at the tens-of-percent level. The short (∼years) variability timescale is incompatible with the IC/CMB model for the X-rays and implies extremely small structures embedded within the kpc-scale jet, and thus requires a reconsideration of many assumptions about jet structure and dynamics.},

	abstract = {The images of supermassive black holes surrounded by optically thin, radiatively inefficient accretion flows, like those observed with the Event Horizon Telescope, are characterized by a bright ring of emission surrounding the black hole shadow. In the Kerr spacetime, this bright ring, when narrow, closely traces the boundary of the shadow and can, with appropriate calibration, serve as its proxy. The present paper expands the validity of this statement by considering two particular spacetime geometries: a solution to the field equations of a modified gravity theory and another that parametrically deviates from Kerr but recovers the Kerr spacetime when its deviation parameters vanish. A covariant, axisymmetric analytic model of the accretion flow based on conservation laws and spanning a broad range of plasma conditions is utilized to calculate synthetic non-Kerr black hole images, which are then analyzed and characterized. We find that in all spacetimes: (i) it is the gravitationally lensed unstable photon orbit that plays the critical role in establishing the diameter of the rings observed in black hole images, not the event horizon or the innermost stable circular orbit, (ii) bright rings in these images scale in size with, and encompass, the boundaries of the black hole shadows, even when deviating significantly from Kerr, and (iii) uncertainties in the physical properties of the accreting plasma introduce subdominant corrections to the relation between the diameter of the image and the diameter of the black hole shadow. These results provide important new theoretical justification for using black hole images to probe and test the spacetimes of supermassive black holes.},

We identiﬁed 25 4.5 µm and 24 X-ray ﬂares in archival data obtained with the Spitzer and Chandra observatories. With the help of general relativistic ray-tracing code, we modeled trajectories of “hot spots” and studied the light curves of the ﬂares for signs of the eﬀects of general relativity. Despite their apparent diversity in shape, all ﬂares share a common, exponential impulse response, a characteristic shape that is the building block of the variability. This shape is symmetric, that is, the rise and fall times are the same. Furthermore, the impulse responses in the NIR and X-ray are identical within uncertainties, with an exponential time constant τ ∼ 15 min. The observed characteristic ﬂare shape is inconsistent with hot-spot orbits viewed edgeon. Individually modeling the light curves of the ﬂares, we derived constraints on the inclination of the orbital plane of the hot spots with respect to the observer (i ∼ 30°, {\textless} 75°) and on the characteristic timescale of the intrinsic variability (tens of minutes).},

	abstract = {We report the time-resolved spectral analysis of a bright near-infrared and moderate X-ray ﬂare of Sgr A . We obtained light curves in the M-, K-, and H-bands in the mid- and near-infrared and in the 2 − 8 keV and 2 − 70 keV bands in the X-ray. The observed spectral slope in the near-infrared band is νLν ∝ ν0.5±0.2; the spectral slope observed in the X-ray band is νLν ∝ ν−0.7±0.5. Using a fast numerical implementation of a synchrotron sphere with constant radius, magnetic ﬁeld and electron density (i.e. a one-zone model), we tested various synchrotron and synchrotron self-Compton scenarios. The observed near-infrared brightness and X-ray faintness, together with the observed spectral slopes, pose challenges for all models explored. We rule out a scenario in which the near-infrared emission is synchrotron emission and the X-ray emission is synchrotron self-Compton. Two realizations of the one-zone model can explain the observed ﬂare and its temporal correlation: one-zone model in which both the near-infrared and X-ray luminosity are produced by synchrotron self-Compton and a model in which the luminosity stems from a cooled synchrotron spectrum. Both models can describe the mean SED and temporal evolution similarly well. In order to describe the mean SED, both models require speciﬁc values of the maximum Lorentz factor γmax, which however diﬀer by roughly two orders of magnitude: the synchrotron self-Compton model suggests that electrons are accelerated to γmax ∼ 500, while cooled synchrotron model requires acceleration up to γmax ∼ 5 × 104. The synchrotron self-Compton scenario requires electron densities of 1010 cm−3 much larger than typical ambient densities in the accretion ﬂow. Furthermore, it requires a variation of the particle density inconsistent with average mass-ﬂow rate inferred from polarization measurements, and can therefore only be realized in an extraordinary accretion event. In contrast, assuming a source size of 1Rs, the cooled synchrotron scenario can be realized with densities and magnetic ﬁelds comparable with the ambient accretion ﬂow. For both models, the temporal evolution is regulated through the maximum acceleration factor γmax, implying that sustained particle acceleration is required to explain at least a part of the temporal evolution of the ﬂare.},

We address this challenge with the accelerated pseudo-transient (PT) iterative method and present a physically motivated derivation. We analytically determine optimal iteration parameters for a variety of basic physical processes and confirm the validity of theoretical predictions with numerical experiments. We provide an efficient numerical implementation of PT solvers on graphical processing units (GPUs) using the Julia language. We achieve a parallel efficiency of more than 96 \% on 2197 GPUs in distributed-memory parallelisation weak-scaling benchmarks. The 2197 GPUs allow for unprecedented tera-scale solutions of 3D variable viscosity Stokes flow on {\textless}span class="inline-formula"{\textgreater}4995$^{\textrm{3}}${\textless}/span{\textgreater} grid cells involving over 1.2 trillion degrees of freedom (DoFs). We verify the robustness of the method by handling contrasts up to 9 orders of magnitude in material parameters such as viscosity and arbitrary distribution of viscous inclusions for different flow configurations. Moreover, we show that this method is well suited to tackle strongly nonlinear problems such as shear-banding in a visco-elasto-plastic medium. A GPU-based implementation can outperform direct-iterative solvers based on central processing units (CPUs) in terms of wall time, even at relatively low spatial resolution. We additionally motivate the accessibility of the method by its conciseness, flexibility, physically motivated derivation and ease of implementation. This solution strategy thus has a great potential for future high-performance computing (HPC) applications, and for paving the road to exascale in the geosciences and beyond.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

We trace the history of astronomical connectionism from the early days of multilayer perceptrons, through the second wave of convolutional and recurrent neural networks, to the current third wave of self-supervised and unsupervised deep learning. We then predict that we will soon enter a fourth wave of astronomical connectionism, in which finetuned versions of an all-encompassing 'foundation' model will replace expertly crafted deep learning models. We argue that such a model can only be brought about through a symbiotic relationship between astronomy and connectionism, whereby astronomy provides high quality multimodal data to train the foundation model, and in turn the foundation model is used to advance astronomical research.},

	abstract = {General-relativistic magnetohydrodynamic (GRMHD) simulations have revolutionized our understanding of black hole accretion. Here, we present a graphics processing unit (GPU) accelerated GRMHD code H-AMR with multi-faceted optimizations that, collectively, accelerate computation by 2-5 orders of magnitude for a wide range of applications. Firstly, it introduces a spherical grid with 3D adaptive mesh reﬁnement that operates in each of the 3 dimensions independently. This allows us to circumvent the Courant condition near the polar singularity, which otherwise cripples high-resolution computational performance. Secondly, we demonstrate that local adaptive time-stepping (LAT) on a logarithmic spherical-polar grid accelerates computation by a factor of 10 compared to traditional hierarchical time-stepping approaches. Jointly, these unique features lead to an effective speed of ∼ 109 zone-cycles-per-second-per-node on 5,400 NVIDIA V100 GPUs (i.e., 900 nodes of the OLCF Summit supercomputer). We illustrate H-AMR’s computational performance by presenting the ﬁrst GRMHD simulation of a tilted thin accretion disk threaded by a toroidal magnetic ﬁeld around a rapidly spinning black hole. With an effective resolution of 13,440 × 4,608 × 8,092 cells, and a total of 22 billion cells and ∼ 0.65 × 108 timesteps, it is among the largest astrophysical simulations ever performed. We ﬁnd that frame-dragging by the black hole tears up the disk into two independently precessing sub-disks. The innermost sub-disk rotation axis intermittently aligns with the black hole spin, demonstrating for the ﬁrst time that such long-sought alignment is possible in the absence of large-scale poloidal magnetic ﬁelds.},

By means of two-dimensional fully kinetic particle-in-cell (PIC) simulations we investigate relativistic collisionless plasmoid-mediated reconnection in magnetically dominated pair plasmas with and without guide ﬁeld. In X-points, where diverging ﬂows result in a non-diagonal thermal pressure tensor, a ﬁnite residence time for particles gives rise to a localized collisionless eﬀective resistivity. Here, for the ﬁrst time for relativistic reconnection in a fully developed plasmoid chain we identify the mechanisms driving the non-ideal electric ﬁeld using a full Ohm’s law by means of a statistical analysis based on our PIC simulations. We show that the non-ideal electric ﬁeld is predominantly driven by gradients of nongyrotropic thermal pressures. We propose a kinetic physics motivated non-uniform eﬀective resistivity model, which is negligible on global scales and becomes signiﬁcant only locally in X-points, that captures the properties of collisionless reconnection with the aim of mimicking its essentials in non-ideal magnetohydrodynamic descriptions. This eﬀective resistivity model provides a viable opportunity to design physically grounded global models for reconnection-powered high-energy emission.},

	abstract = {We study the half-light radius versus black hole mass as well as the luminosity versus black hole mass relations in active galactic nuclei (AGN) when the disc is illuminated by the X-ray corona. We used KYNSED, a recently developed spectral model for studying broadband spectral energy distribution in AGN. We considered non-illuminated Novikov-Thorne discs and X-ray illuminated discs based on a Novikov-Thorne temperature radial profile. We also considered the case where the temperature profile is modified by a colour-correction factor. We assumed that the X-ray luminosity is equal to the accretion power that is dissipated to the disc below a transition radius. The half-light radius of X-ray illuminated radii can be up to some three to four times greater than the radius of a standard disc, even for a non-spinning black hole, due to the fact that the absorbed X-rays act as a secondary source of energy, increasing the disc temperature. Non-illuminated discs are consistent with observations, but only at the 2.5sigma level. On the other hand, X-ray illuminated discs can explain both the half-light radius-black hole mass as well as the luminosity-black hole mass relation in AGN, for a wide range of physical parameters. In addition, we show that the observed X-ray luminosity of the gravitationally lensed quasars is fully consistent with the X-ray luminosity that is necessary for heating the disc. X-ray disc illumination was proposed many years ago to explain various features that are commonly observed in the X-ray spectra of AGN. Recently, we showed that X-ray illumination of accretion disc can also explain the observed UV/optical time-lags in AGN, while in this work, we show that the same model can also account for the quasar micro-lensing disc size problem. These results support the hypothesis of the disc X-ray illumination in AGN.},

	abstract = {In this study we present a method to estimate posterior distributions for standard accretion torque model parameters and binary orbital parameters for X-ray binaries using a nested sampling algorithm for Bayesian Parameter Estimation. We study the spin evolution of two Be X-ray binary systems in the Magellanic Clouds, RX J0520.5-6932 and RX J0209-7427, during major outbursts, in which they surpassed the Eddington-limit. Moreover, we apply our method to the recently discovered Swift J0243.6+6124; the only known Galactic pulsating ultra-luminous X-ray source. This is an excellent candidate for studying the disc evolution at super-Eddington accretion rates, for its luminosity span several orders of magnitude during its outburst, with a maximum LX that exceeded the Eddington limit by a factor of ∼ 10. Our method, when applied to RX J0520.5-6932 and RX J0209-7427, is able to identify the more favourable torque model for each system, while yielding meaningful ranges for the NS and orbital parameters. Our analysis for Swift J0243.6+6124 illustrates that, contrary to the standard torque model predictions, the magnetospheric radius (Rm) and the Alfvén radius (RA) are not proportional to each other when surpassing the Eddington limit. Reported distance estimates of this source range between 5 and 7 kpc. Smaller distances require non-typical neutron star properties (i.e. mass and radius) and possibly lower radiative eﬃciency of the accretion column.},

A polarization degree smaller than Π {\textless} 4.7\% (at the 99\% c.l.) is derived in the 2-8 keV energy range, where emission is dominated by the primary component ascribed to the hot corona. The broad-band spectrum, inferred from a simultaneous ﬁt to the IXPE, NuSTAR, and XMM-Newton data, is well reproduced by a power law with photon index Γ = 1.85 ± 0.01 and a high-energy cutoﬀ 𝐸C = 120 ± 15 keV.

BHAC has been designed to solve the equations of ideal general-relativistic magnetohydrodynamics in arbitrary spacetimes and exploits adaptive mesh reﬁnement techniques with an eﬃcient block-based approach. Several spacetimes have already been implemented and tested. We demonstrate the validity of BHAC by means of various one-, two-, and three-dimensional test problems, as well as through a close comparison with the HARM3D code in the case of a torus accreting onto a black hole. The convergence of a turbulent accretion scenario is investigated with several diagnostics and we ﬁnd accretion rates and horizon-penetrating ﬂuxes to be convergent to within a few percent when the problem is run in three dimensions. Our analysis also involves the study of the corresponding thermal synchrotron emission, which is performed by means of a new general-relativistic radiative transfer code, BHOSS. The resulting synthetic intensity maps of accretion onto black holes are found to be convergent with increasing resolution and are anticipated to play a crucial role in the interpretation of horizon-scale images resulting from upcoming radio observations of the source at the Galactic Center.},

Emitted from the innermost regions of the accretion disk, this X-ray spectral component carries with it information not only about the plasma that resides in these extreme conditions, but also the black hole spin, a marker of the formation and accretion history of these objects. The models currently used to interpret the reflection spectrum are often simplistic, however, approximating the disk as an infinitely thin, optically thick plane of material orbiting in circular Keplerian orbits around the central object. Using a new relativistic ray-tracing suite (Fenrir) that allows for more complex disk approximations, we examine the effects that disk thickness may have on the reflection spectrum. Assuming a lamppost corona, we find that finite disk thickness can have a variety of effects on the reflection spectrum, including a truncation of the blue wing (from self-shadowing of the accretion disk) and an enhancement of the red wing (from the irradiation of the central “eye wall” of the inner disk). We deduce the systematic
errors on black hole spin and height that may result from neglecting these effects.},

We adopt the most compact form of CT, which requires the ﬁeld be represented by area-averages at cell faces. We demonstrate that the ﬂuxes of the area-averaged ﬁeld used by CT can be made consistent with the ﬂuxes of the volume-averaged ﬁeld returned by a Riemann solver if they obey certain simple relationships. We use these relationships to derive new algorithms for constructing the CT ﬂuxes at grid cell corners which reduce exactly to the equivalent one-dimensional solver for plane-parallel, grid-aligned ﬂow. We show that the PPM reconstruction algorithm must include multidimensional terms for MHD, and we describe a number of important extensions that must be made to CTU in order for it to be used for MHD with CT. We present the results of a variety of test problems to demonstrate the method is accurate and robust.},

In the last decade, there has been significant progress in the development of the analysis of these features, thanks to more sophisticated astrophysical models and new observational facilities. Here we review the state-of-the-art in relativistic reflection modeling, listing assumptions and simplifications that may affect, at some level, the final measurements and may be investigated better in the future.

The strong variability of the source is best explained in terms of intrinsic X-ray ﬂux variations and in the context of the light-bending model: the primary, variable emission is reprocessed by the accretion disk, which produces secondary, less variable, reﬂected emission. The broad Fe Kα proﬁle is, as usual for this source, well explained by relativistic effects occurring in the innermost regions of the accretion disk around a rapidly rotating black hole. We also discuss the alternative model in which the broadening of the Fe Kα is due to the complex nature of the circumnuclear absorbing structure. Even if this model cannot be ruled out, it is disfavored on statistical grounds. We also detected an occultation event likely caused by broad-line region clouds crossing the line of sight.},

We suggest that the observed weakness of X-ray reflection from the disk is due to bulk motion of the emitting hot plasma away from the reflector. A mildly relativistic motion causes aberration, reducing X-ray emission toward the disk. This in turn reduces the reprocessed radiation from the disk and leads to a hard spectrum of the X-ray source. The resulting spectral index is Γ{\textasciitilde}1.9/sqrt(B), where B=γ(1+β) is the aberration factor for a bulk velocity β=v/c. The observed Γ{\textasciitilde}1.6 and the amount of reflection (R{\textasciitilde}0.3) in Cyg X-1 in the hard state can both be explained assuming a bulk velocity β{\textasciitilde}0.3. We discuss one possible scenario: the compact magnetic flares are dominated by e+/- pairs, which are ejected away from the reflector by the pressure of the reflected radiation. We also discuss physical constraints on the disk-corona model and argue that the magnetic flares are related to magnetorotational instabilities in the accretion disk.},

We point out a number of inconsistencies in the widely used lamppost model relxilllp, e.g., neglecting the redshift of the photons emitted by the lamppost that are directly observed. They appear to invalidate those model fitting results for which the source distances from the horizon are within several gravitational radii. Furthermore, if those results were correct, most of the photons produced in the lamppost would be trapped by the BH, and the luminosity generated in the source as measured at infinity would be much larger than that observed. This appears to be in conflict with the observed smooth state transitions between the hard and soft states of X-ray binaries. The required increase of the accretion rate and the associated efficiency reduction also present a problem for active galactic nuclei. Then, those models imply the luminosity measured in the local frame is much higher than that produced in the source and measured at infinity, due to the additional effects of time dilation and redshift, and the electron temperature is significantly higher than that observed. We show that these conditions imply that the fitted sources would be out of the e± pair equilibrium. On the other hand, the above issues pose relatively minor problems for sources at large distances from the BH, where relxilllp can still be used.},

They are needed when the ionising source varies faster than the typical gas equilibration timescale. Indeed, using equilibrium models to analyse spectra of non-equilibrium photoionised gas may lead to inaccurate results and prevents a solid assessment of the gas density, physics and geometry.},

We then provide analytic fitting formulae for the illumination as a function of the source height h and the black hole angular momentum a. We find that for a source on the disk symmetry axis and with h/M {\textgreater} 3, the main effect of the parameter a is allowing the disk to extend to smaller radii (approaching r/M → 1 as a/M → 1) and thus allowing the illumination of regions of much higher rotational velocity and redshift. We also compute the illumination profiles for anisotropic emission associated with the motion of the source relative to the accretion disk and present the fractions of photons absorbed by the black hole, intercepted by the disk, or escaping to infinity for both isotropic and anisotropic emission for a/M = 0 and 0.99. As the anisotropy (of a source approaching the disk) increases, the illumination profile reduces (approximately) to a single power law, whose index q, because of absorption of the beamed photons by the black hole, saturates to a value no higher than q ≳ 3. Finally, we compute the fluorescent Fe line profiles associated with the specific illumination and compare them among various cases.},

We investigate here the latter case, assuming that the X-ray source is located on the symmetry axis of the Kerr BH. We discuss eﬀects relevant to a proper computation of the reﬂected radiation and we implement them in the model for data analysis, reflkerrV. We apply it to the simultaneous Suzaku and NuSTAR observation of Cyg X-1 in the hard state and we ﬁnd a good ﬁt for an untruncated disc irradiated by the source moving away from it at 0.36c. However, we ﬁnd a slightly better solution in a geometry closely approximating the truncated disc irradiated by an inner hot ﬂow. In this solution we either still need a subrelativistic outﬂow or the source opposite to the observer must contribute to the directly observed radiation. We also discuss diﬀerences between the implementation of the outﬂow eﬀect in reflkerrV and in relxilllpCp.},

Accretion-induced collapse (AIC) from oxygen-neon-magnesium white dwarf (ONeMg WD) + red giant (RG) star binaries is one promising channel to form these SyXBs, while other long standing formation channels have diﬃculties to produce these SyXBs. By considering non-magnetic and magnetic ONeMg WDs, I investigate the evolution of ONeMg WD + RG binaries with the mesa stellar evolution code for producing SyXBs with non-magnetic or magnetized NSs. In the pre-AIC evolution with magnetic conﬁnement, the mass accumulation eﬃciency of the accreting WD is increased at low mass transfer rate compared to the nonmagnetic case. The newborn NSs formed via AIC of highly magnetized WDs could inherit the large magnetic ﬁeld through conservation of magnetic ﬂux, and the systems could have a long age compatible with that of the red giant companions. These young and highly magnetized NSs could accrete matters from the stellar wind of the giant companions to that shine as those observed SyXBs, and could preserve their high magnetic ﬁeld during this time. The mesa calculation results show that the initial parameter (initial RG mass and orbital period) space for the AIC with magnetic conﬁnement to form SyXBs with highly magnetized NSs shifts to be lower and narrower compared to that of the no magnetic conﬁnement case.},

Recently, gravitational waves opened the possibility to probe the existence of horizons and investigate the nature of compact objects. This is of particular interest given some quantum-gravity models which predict the presence of horizonless and singularity-free compact objects. Such exotic compact objects can emit a diﬀerent gravitational-wave signal relative to the black hole case. In this thesis, we analyze the stability of horizonless compact objects, and derive a generic framework to compute their characteristic oscillation frequencies. We provide an analytical, physicallymotivated template to search for the gravitational-wave echoes emitted by these objects in the late-time postmerger signal. Finally, we infer how extreme mass-ratio inspirals observable by future gravitational-wave detectors will allow for model-independent tests of the black hole paradigm.},

	abstract = {In the near future, wide ﬁeld surveys will discover 1000’s of new strongly lensed quasars, and these will be monitored with unprecedented cadence by the Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST). Many of these will undergo caustic-crossing microlensing events over the 10-year LSST survey, in which a sharp caustic feature from a stellar body in the lensing galaxy crosses the inner accretion disk. Caustic-crossing events oﬀer the unique opportunity to probe the vicinity of the central supermassive black hole for 100s of quasars with multi-platform follow-up triggered by LSST monitoring. To prepare for these observations, we have developed detailed simulations of caustic-crossing light curves. These employ a realistic analytic model of the inner accretion disk that reveals the strong surface brightness asymmetries introduced when fully accounting for both special- and general-relativistic eﬀects. We demonstrate that an inﬂection in the caustic-crossing light curve due to the innermost stable circular orbit (ISCO) can be detected in reasonable follow-up observations and can be analyzed to constrain ISCO size. We also demonstrate that a convolutional neural network can be trained to predict ISCO size more reliably than traditional approaches and can also recover source orientation with high accuracy.},

	abstract = {In a novel approach employing implicit likelihood inference (ILI), also known as likelihood-free inference, we calibrate the parameters of cosmological hydrodynamic simulations against observations, which has previously been unfeasible due to the high computational cost of these simulations. For computational eﬃciency, we train neural networks as emulators on ∼ 1000 cosmological simulations from the CAMELS project to estimate simulated observables, taking as input the cosmological and astrophysical parameters, and use these emulators as surrogates to the cosmological simulations. Using the cosmic star formation rate density (SFRD) and, separately, stellar mass functions (SMFs) at different redshifts, we perform ILI on selected cosmological and astrophysical parameters (Ωm, σ8, stellar wind feedback, and kinetic black hole feedback) and obtain full 6-dimensional posterior distributions. In the performance test, the ILI from the emulated SFRD (SMFs) can recover the target observables with a relative error of 0.17\% (0.4\%). We ﬁnd that degeneracies exist between the parameters inferred from the emulated SFRD, conﬁrmed with new full cosmological simulations. We also ﬁnd that the SMFs can break the degeneracy in the SFRD, which indicates that the SMFs provide complementary constraints for the parameters. Further, we ﬁnd that the parameter combination inferred from an observationally-inferred SFRD reproduces the target observed SFRD very well, whereas, in the case of the SMFs, the inferred and observed SMFs show signiﬁcant discrepancies that indicate potential limitations of the current galaxy formation modeling and calibration framework, and/or systematic diﬀerences and inconsistencies between observations of the stellar mass function.},

This line can potentially be quite a powerful tool to probe the spacetime geometry around these objects and test the Kerr black hole hypothesis. In a previous paper, we studied the ability to constrain possible deviations from the Kerr solution from the standard time-integrated iron line spectrum within the Cardoso-Pani-Rico framework. In the present work, we expand on that study and consider iron line reverberation mapping in the CPR framework. That is, we consider the time-evolution of the iron line profile in response to fluctuations in the X-ray primary source. Our simulations clearly show that the time information in reverberation mapping can better constrain the background metric than the time-integrated approach, and this is true, notably, for the deformation parameter \${\textbackslash}epsilon{\textasciicircum}r\_3\$, which is only weakly informed by a time-integrated observation.},

We consider the metric introduced in [Ghasemi-Nodehi and Bambi, Eur. Phys. J. C 76, 290 (2016)]. The fundamental frequencies in this metric are sensitive to some of the metric parameters but insensitive to other parameters, which means, the diﬀerences in fundamental frequencies in this metric and those in the Kerr ones can be signiﬁcant for small changes of some but not all parameters around the Kerr value. By comparing with the QPO observations of GRO J1655-40, we ﬁnd that only one parameter of the Ghasemi-Nodehi-Bambi metric can be strongly constrained, but other parameters cannot. We also use nested algorithm to investigate whether better constraints on the Ghasemi-Nodehi- Bambi metric parameters can be obtained from QPO observations of multiple objects by simulations. We ﬁnd that four parameters can be strongly constrained while other parameters cannot . Our results suggest that QPOs may be important tools for testing the Kerr metric.},

The purpose of this work is to understand whether X-ray reflection spectroscopy can distinguish the neutron star from the Kerr solution of General Relativity. I found that for the higher value of spin and multipole moment parameters, there are small differences in the shape of neutron star iron lines. It is hard to distinguish neutron star iron lines from Kerr ones due to the small deviations. Also, electromagnetic wave observation of slow rotating neutron stars is marginally consistent with Kerr black holes of general relativity.},

The metric contains 11 parameters in addition to the mass and spin parameters. One can recover the Kerr case by setting all parameters to one. In this paper, I study the continuum-fitting method in Ghasemi-Nodehi-Bambi background. I show the impact of each of the parameters on the spectra. I then employ {\textbackslash}c\{hi\}2 studies and show that using the continuum-fitting method all parameters of Ghasemi-Nodehi- Bambi spacetime are degenerate. However, the parameter b9 can be constrained in the case of a high spin value and the Ghasemi-Nodehi-Bambi black hole as reference. This degeneracy means that the spectra of the Kerr case cannot be distinguished from spectra produced in Ghasemi-Nodehi-Bmabi spacetime. This is a problem as regards measuring the spin of astrophysical black holes and constrain possible deviations from the Kerr case of General Relativity.},

Our spectra are in good agreement with those from analytical codes for low/moderate optical depths, but differ signiﬁcantly, as expected, for optical depths larger than a few.

	abstract = {The classical radiation pressure instability has been a persistent theoretical feature of thin, radiatively eﬃcient accretion disks with accretion rates ∼ 1 − 100\% of the Eddington rate. But there is only limited evidence of its occurrence in nature: rapid heartbeat oscillations of a few X-ray binaries and now, perhaps, the new class of hourly X-ray transients called quasi-periodic eruptions (QPEs). The accretion disks formed in tidal disruption events (TDEs) have been observed to peacefully trespass through the range of unstable accretion rates without exhibiting any clear sign of the instability. We try to explain the occurrence or otherwise of this instability in these systems, by constructing steady state 1D models of thin magnetic accretion disks. The local magnetic pressure in the disk is assumed to be dominated by toroidal ﬁelds arising from a dynamo sourced by magneto-rotational instability (MRI). We choose a physically motivated criterion of MRI saturation, validated by recent magnetohydrodynamic simulations, to determine the strength of magnetic pressure in the disk. The resulting magnetic pressure support eﬃciently shrinks: (1) the parameter space of unstable mass accretion rates, explaining the absence of instability in systems such as TDEs and (2) the range of unstable radii in the inner accretion disk, which can shorten the quasi-periods of instability limitcycles by more than three orders of magnitude, explaining the observed periods (∼ a few hrs) of QPEs. In addition to examining stability properties of strongly magnetized disks, we predict other observational signatures such as spectral hardening factors and jet luminosities to test the compatibility of our disk models with observations of apparently stable TDE disks.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/2211.00044},
	abstract = {Supermassive black-hole binaries are driven to merger by dynamical friction, loss-cone scattering of individual stars, disk migration, and gravitational-wave emission. Two main formation scenarios are expected. Binaries that form in gas-poor galactic environments do not experience disk migration and likely enter the gravitational-wave dominated phase with roughly isotropic spin orientations. Comparatively, binaries that evolve in gas-rich galactic environments might experience prominent phases of disk accretion, where the Bardeen-Petterson effect acts to align the spins of the black holes with the orbital angular momentum of the disk. However, if the accretion disk breaks alignment is expected to be strongly suppressed -- a phenomenon that was recently shown to occur in a large portion of the parameter space. In this paper, we develop a semi-analytic model of joint gas-driven migration and spin alignment of supermassive black-hole binaries taking into account the impact of disk breaking for the first time. Our model predicts the occurrence of distinct subpopulations of binaries, implying that future gravitational-wave observations of merging black holes could potentially be used to (i) discriminate between gas-rich and gas-poor hosts and (ii) constrain the dynamics of warped accretion disks.},

	abstract = {The determination of the chemical composition of interplanetary coronal mass ejection (ICME) plasma is an open issue. More specifically, it is not yet fully understood how remote sensing observations of the solar corona plasma during solar disturbances evolve into plasma properties measured in situ away from the Sun. The ambient conditions of the background interplanetary plasma are important for space weather because they inﬂuence the evolutions, arrival times, and geo-eﬀectiveness of the disturbances. The Reverse In situ and MHD APproach (RIMAP) is a technique to reconstruct the heliosphere on the ecliptic plane (including the magnetic Parker spiral) directly from in situ measurements acquired at 1 AU. It combines analytical and numerical approaches, preserving the small-scale longitudinal variability of the wind ﬂow lines. In this work, we use RIMAP to test the interaction of an ICME with the interplanetary medium. We model the propagation of a homogeneous non-magnetised (i.e. with no internal ﬂux rope) cloud starting at 800 km/s at 0.1 AU out to 1.1 AU. Our 3D magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) simulation made with the PLUTO MHD code shows the formation of a compression front ahead of the ICME, continuously driven by the cloud expansion. Using a passive tracer, we ﬁnd that the initial ICME material does not fragment behind the front during its propagation, and we quantify the mixing of the propagating plasma cloud with the ambient solar wind plasma, which can be detected at 1 AU.},

	abstract = {One of the leading explanations for the origin of Fermi Bubbles is a past jet activity in the Galactic center supermassive black hole Sgr A\${\textasciicircum}*\$. The claimed jets are often assumed to be perpendicular to the Galactic plane. Motivated by the orientation of pc-scale nuclear stellar disk and gas streams, and a low inclination of the accretion disk around Sgr A\${\textasciicircum}*\$ inferred by the Event Horizon Telescope, we perform hydrodynamical simulations of nuclear jets significantly tilted relative to the Galactic rotation axis. The observed axisymmetry and hemisymmetry (north-south symmetry) of Fermi/eROSITA bubbles (FEBs) due to quasi-steady jets in Sgr A\${\textasciicircum}*\$ can be produced if the jet had a super-Eddington power (\${\textbackslash}gtrsim 5{\textbackslash}times 10{\textasciicircum}\{44\}\$ erg s\${\textasciicircum}\{-1\}\$) for a short time (jet active period \${\textbackslash}lesssim 6\$ kyr) for a reasonable jet opening angle (\${\textbackslash}lesssim 10{\textasciicircum}{\textbackslash}circ\$). Such powerful explosions are, however, incompatible with the observed O VIII/O VII line ratio towards the bubbles, even after considering electron-proton temperature non-equilibrium. We argue that the only remaining options for producing FEBs are i) a low-luminosity (\${\textbackslash}approx 10{\textasciicircum}\{40.5-41\}\$ erg s\${\textasciicircum}\{-1\}\$)) magnetically dominated jet or accretion wind from the Sgr A\${\textasciicircum}*\$, and ii) a SNe or TDE driven wind of a similar luminosity from the Galactic center.},

	abstract = {Electromagnetic radiation plays a crucial role in various physical and chemical processes. Hence, almost all astrophysical simulations require some form of radiative transfer model. Despite many innovations in radiative transfer algorithms and their implementation, realistic radiative transfer models remain very computationally expensive, such that one often has to resort to approximate descriptions. The complexity of these models makes it diﬃcult to assess the validity of any approximation and to quantify uncertainties on the model results. This impedes scientiﬁc rigour, in particular, when comparing models to observations, or when using their results as input for other models. We present a probabilistic numerical approach to address these issues by treating radiative transfer as a Bayesian linear regression problem. This allows us to model uncertainties on the input and output of the model with the variances of the associated probability distributions. Furthermore, this approach naturally allows us to create reduced-order radiative transfer models with a quantiﬁable accuracy. These are approximate solutions to exact radiative transfer models, in contrast to the exact solutions to approximate models that are often used. As a ﬁrst demonstration, we derive a probabilistic version of the method of characteristics, a commonly-used technique to solve radiative transfer problems.},

The transition is accompanied by an increasing temperature of the disk and a softening of the corona emission while the inner disk radius remains stable. Assuming a lamppost geometry, the corona height is also found to stay close to the black hole across the state transition. If we include the Comptonization of the reﬂection spectrum, the scattering fraction parameter is found to decrease during the state transition. We also perform an analysis with a reﬂection model designed for hot accretion disks of stellar mass black holes where the surface of the innermost accretion disk is illuminated by emission from the corona and the thermal disk below. Our results support the scenario in which the state transition is assciated with variations in the corona properties.},

In this work, we re-analyze a selected set of high-quality NuSTAR and Suzaku data of Galactic black holes and we ﬁt the reﬂection component with three different models: relxill\_nk, in which the ionization parameter and the electron density are constant, relxillion\_nk, where the electron density is still constant but the ionization proﬁle is described by a power law, and relxilldgrad\_nk, where the electron density proﬁle is described by a power law and the ionization proﬁle is calculated self-consistently from the electron density and the emissivity. While relxillion\_nk may provide slightly better ﬁts, we do not ﬁnd any substantial difference in the estimate of the properties of the sources among the three models.

	abstract = {Continuum reverberation mapping of AGN can provide new insight into the nature and geometry of the accretion ﬂow. Some of the X-rays from the central corona irradiating the disc are absorbed, increasing the local disc temperature. This gives an additional re-processed contribution to the spectral energy distribution (SED) which is lagged and smeared relative to the driving X-ray lightcurve. We directly calculate this reverberation from the accretion disc, creating fully time dependent SEDs for a given X-ray light-curve. We apply this to the intensive monitoring data on Faraill 9 (Hernández Santisteban et al. 2020), and ﬁnd that it is not possible to produce the observed UV variability by X-ray reprocessing of the observed lightcurve from the disc. Instead, we ﬁnd that the majority of the variability must be intrinsic to the UV emission process, adding to evidence from changing-look AGN that this region has a structure which is quite unlike a Shakura-Sunyaev disc. We ﬁlter out this long timescale variability and ﬁnd that reprocessing alone is still insuﬃcient to explain even the fast variability in our assumed geometry of a central source illuminating a ﬂat disc. The amplitude of reprocessing can be increased by any vertical structure such as the BLR and/or an inner disc wind, giving a better match. Fundamentally though the model is missing the major contributor to the variabilty, which is from the UV/EUV emission region itself rather than reprocessing.},

Based on the forge and bridge N-body simulation suites presented in companion papers, we construct 500,000 deg2 of mock Stage-IV lensing data, sampling a pair of 4-dimensional volumes designed for the training of emulators. We validate the accuracy of MGLenS with inference analyses based on the lensing power spectrum exploiting our implementation of f (R) and nDGP theoretical predictions within the cosmoSIS cosmological inference package. A Fisher analysis reveals that the vast majority of the constraining power from such a survey comes from the highest redshift galaxies alone. We further ﬁnd from a full likelihood sampling that cosmic shear can achieve 95\% CL constraints on the modiﬁed gravity parameters of log10 fR0 {\textless} −5.24 and log10 [H0rc] {\textgreater} −0.05, after marginalising over intrinsic alignments of galaxies and including scales up to = 5000. Such a survey setup could in fact detect with more than 3σ conﬁdence f (R) values larger than 3 × 10−6 and H0rc smaller than 1.0. Scale cuts at = 3000 reduce the degeneracy breaking between S 8 and the modiﬁed gravity parameters, while photometric redshift uncertainty seem to play a subdominant role in our error budget. We ﬁnally explore the consequences of analysing data with the wrong gravity model, and report the catastrophic biases for a number of possible scenarios. The Stage-IV MGLenS simulations, the forge and bridge emulators and the cosmoSIS interface modules will be made publicly available upon journal acceptance.},

	abstract = {Based on entropy considerations and the arrow of time Penrose argued that the universe must have started in a special initial singularity with vanishing Weyl curvature. This is often interpreted to be at odds with inﬂation. Here we argue just the opposite, that Penrose’s persuasions are in fact consistent with inﬂation. Using the example of power law inﬂation, we show that inﬂation begins with a past null singularity, where Weyl tensor vanishes when the metric is initially exactly conformally ﬂat. This initial state precisely obeys Penrose’s conditions. The initial null singularity breaks T -reversal spontaneously and picks the arrow of time. It can be regulated and interpreted as a creation of a universe from nothing, initially ﬁtting in a bubble of Planckian size when it materializes. Penrose’s initial conditions are favored by the initial O(4) symmetry of the bubble, selected by extremality of the regulated Euclidean action. The predicted observables are marginally in tension with the data, but they can ﬁt if small corrections to power law inﬂation kick in during the last 60 efolds.},

	abstract = {We present high-resolution, three-dimensional hydrodynamic simulations of the fueling of supermassive black holes in elliptical galaxies from a turbulent medium on galactic scales, taking M87* as a typical case. The simulations use a new GPU-accelerated version of the Athena++ AMR code, and span more than 6 orders of magnitude in radius, reaching scales similar to the black hole horizon. The key physical ingredients are radiative cooling and a phenomenological heating model. We ﬁnd that the accretion ﬂow takes the form of multiphase gas at radii less than about a kpc. The cold gas accretion includes two dynamically distinct stages: the typical disk stage in which the cold gas resides in a rotationally supported disk and relatively rare chaotic stages ( 10\% of the time) in which the cold gas inﬂows via chaotic streams. Though cold gas accretion dominates the time-averaged accretion rate at intermediate radii, accretion at the smallest radii is dominated by hot virialized gas at most times. The accretion rate scales with radius as M˙ ∝ r1/2 when hot gas dominates and we obtain M˙ 10−4 − 10−3 M yr−1 near the event horizon, similar to what is inferred from EHT observations. The orientation of the cold gas disk can diﬀer signiﬁcantly on diﬀerent spatial scales. We propose a subgrid model for accretion in lower-resolution simulations in which the hot gas accretion rate is suppressed relative to the Bondi rate by ∼ (rg/rBondi)1/2. Our results can also provide more realistic initial conditions for simulations of black hole accretion at the event horizon scale.},

	abstract = {It has long been recognized that quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs) in the X-ray light curves of accreting black hole and neutron star binaries have the potential to be powerful diagnostics of strong field gravity. However, this potential cannot be fulfilled without a working theoretical model, which has remained elusive. Perhaps, the most promising model associates the QPO with Lense-Thirring precession of the inner accretion flow, with the changes in viewing angle and Doppler boosting modulating the flux over the course of a precession cycle. Here, we consider the polarization signature of a precessing inner accretion flow. We use simple assumptions about the Comptonization process generating the emitted spectrum and take all relativistic effects into account, parallel transporting polarization vectors toward the observer along null geodesics in the Kerr metric. We find that both the degree of linear polarization and the polarization angle should be modulated on the QPO frequency. We calculate the predicted absolute rms variability amplitude of the polarization degree and angle for a specific model geometry. We find that it should be possible to detect these modulations for a reasonable fraction of parameter space with a future X-ray polarimeter such as NASA’s Polarization Spectroscopic Telescope Array (the satellite incarnation of the balloon experiment X-Calibur).},

	abstract = {We use XMM-Newton blank-sky and closed-cover background data to explore background subtraction methods for large extended sources filling the EPIC field of view, such as nearby galaxy clusters, for which local background estimation is difficult. In particular, we investigate the uncertainties of the background modeling in the 0.8-7.0 keV band that affect cluster analyses. To model the background, we have constructed composite data sets from the blank-sky observations and compared them to the individual blank-sky observations to evaluate the modeling error. Our results apply to data obtained with thin and medium optical filters and in full frame and extended full frame modes. As expected, the modeling uncertainty is determined by how the EPIC background flares are filtered. We find that to keep this uncertainty tolerable, one has to use a much more restrictive filter than that commonly applied. In particular, because flares have highly variable spectra, not all of them are identified by filtering the E{\textgreater}10 keV light curve. We tried using the outer part of the EPIC field of view for monitoring the background in a softer band (1-5 keV). We find that one needs to discard the time periods when either the hard-band or the soft-band rate exceeds the nominal value by more than 20\% in order to limit the 90\% CL background uncertainty to between +/-5\% at E=4-7 keV and +/-20\% at E=0.8-1 keV, for both MOS and PN. This compares to a 10\%-30\% respective PN uncertainty when only the hard-band light curve is used for filtering, and to a 15\%-45\% PN uncertainty when applying the commonly used 2-3 σ filtering method. Adding such a soft-band filter on average results in only a 5\%-10\% reduction of the useful exposure time. We illustrate our method on the nearby cluster A1795. The above background uncertainties convert into systematic temperature uncertainties between about +/-1\% at r=3'-4' and +/-20\%-25\% (about +/-1 keV for A1795) at r=10'-15'. For comparison, the commonly applied 2-3 σ clipping of the hard-band light curve misses a significant number of flares, rendering the temperatures beyond r=10' unconstrained. Thus, the background uncertainties do not prohibit the EPIC temperature profile analysis of low-brightness regions, such as outer regions of galaxy clusters, provided a conservative flare filtering such as the double-filtering method with +/-20\% limits is used.},

For a small number of problems, previous studies have shown that the fractional bias introduced by these approximations is often small when the counts are high. However, we show that for a broad class of problem, unless the number of data bins is far smaller than √\{N\_c\}, where Nc is the total number of counts in the data set, the bias will still likely be comparable to, or even exceed, the statistical error. Conversely, we find that fits using Cash's C-statistic give comparatively unbiased parameter estimates when the counts are high. Taking into account their well-known problems in the low-count regime, we conclude that these approximate χ2 methods should not routinely be used for fitting an arbitrary, parameterized model to Poisson-distributed data, irrespective of the number of counts per bin, and instead the C-statistic should be adopted. We discuss several practical aspects of using the C-statistic in modeling real data. We illustrate the bias for two specific problems—measuring the count rate from a light curve and obtaining the temperature of a thermal plasma from its X-ray spectrum measured with the Chandra X-ray observatory. In the context of X-ray astronomy, we argue the bias could give rise to systematically miscalibrated satellites and a {\textasciitilde}5-10\% shift in galaxy cluster scaling relations.},

While it is well established that neutron stars receive natal kicks upon formation, it is unclear whether black holes do as well. Here, we consider the low-mass X-ray binary MAXI J1305-704, which has been reported to have a space velocity 200 km/s. In addition to integrating its trajectory to infer its velocity upon formation of its black hole, we reconstruct its evolutionary history, accounting for recent estimates of its period, black hole mass, mass ratio, and donor eﬀective temperature from photometric and spectroscopic observations.

However, despite signiﬁcant eﬀorts in the past decades, we do not have yet any robust theoretical framework to solve the problem of spacetime singularities. In this context, the past few years have seen an increasing interest in the study of phenomenological scenarios to describe singularity-free black holes, gravitational collapses, and cosmological models. In the present work, we consider the recent proposal by Mazza, Franzin \& Liberati for a rotating regular black hole and we measure their regularization parameter l from the available X-ray and gravitational wave black hole data. For l = 0, we recover the singular Kerr solution of general relativity, while for l = 0 we can have a regular black hole or a regular wormhole. Our analysis shows that the available data are consistent with a vanishing regularization parameter l and we can constrain its value. From a NuSTAR spectrum of the Galactic black hole in EXO 1846–031, we ﬁnd l/M {\textless} 0.49 (90\% CL). From the gravitational wave event GW190707A, we ﬁnd l/M {\textless} 0.72 (90\% CL).},

In tidal disruption events (TDEs) in which a supermassive black hole starts to accrete the bound debris, if the black hole is spinning, in general, the stellar orbit is inclined with the black hole spin, as is the accretion disk formed following circularization and radiative cooling of the debris. Xiang-Gruess et al. studied in detail the stellar debris evolution and disk formation in TDEs when the stellar orbit is inclined, and found that a warped disk would form under certain conditions. In this work we investigate properties of a time-resolved ﬂuorescent iron line originating from a warped disk that is irradiated by the initial X-ray ﬂare. We ﬁnd that the time-resolved spectrum shows distinct features before and after a critical time. This critical time depends on the BP radius rBP, i.e., the outer boundary of the inner aligned disk, while the line width during the later stage of the X-ray ﬂare is sensitive to the inclination of the outer disk ﬂow. This demonstrates that time-resolved X-ray spectroscopy can be a powerful tool to probe the BP effect in TDE ﬂares and can be used to measure the BP radius as well as put constraints on the black hole mass and spin.},

	abstract = {X-ray observations suggest high compactness of coronæ in active galactic nuclei as well as in X-ray binaries. The compactness of the source implies a strong radial dependence in the illumination of the accretion disc. This will, for any reasonable radial proﬁle of the density, lead to a radial proﬁle of the disc ionization. Svoboda et al. showed on a single example that assuming a radially structured ionization proﬁle of the disc can cause an artiﬁcial increase of the radial emissivity parameter. We further investigate how the X-ray spectra are modiﬁed and quantify this effect for a wide range of parameters. Computations are carried out with the current state-of-the-art models for relativistic reﬂection. We simulated spectra using the response ﬁles of the microcalorimeter X-IFU, which is planned to be on board of Athena. We assumed typical parameters for X-ray bright Seyfert-1 galaxies and considered two scenarios for the disc ionization: (1) a radial proﬁle for the disc ionization and (2) a constant disc ionization. We found that steep emissivity proﬁles can be indeed achieved due to the radial proﬁle of the disc ionization, which becomes more important for the cases where the corona is located at low heights above the black hole and this effect may even be more prominent than the geometrical effects. We also found that the cases with high inner disc ionization, rapidly decreasing with radius, may result in an inaccurate black hole spin measurements.},

	abstract = {In the standard paradigm, astrophysical black holes can be described solely by their mass and angular momentum - commonly referred to as ‘spin’ - resulting from the process of their birth and subsequent growth via accretion. Whilst the mass has a standard Newtonian interpretation, the spin does not, with the effect of non-zero spin leaving an indelible imprint on the space-time closest to the black hole. As a consequence of relativistic frame-dragging, particle orbits are affected both in terms of stability and precession, which impacts on the emission characteristics of accreting black holes both stellar mass in black hole binaries (BHBs) and supermassive in active galactic nuclei (AGN). Over the last 30 years, techniques have been developed that take into account these changes to estimate the spin which can then be used to understand the birth and growth of black holes and potentially the powering of powerful jets. In this chapter we provide a broad overview of both the theoretical effects of spin, the means by which it can be estimated and the results of ongoing campaigns.},

We present a detailed, general relativistic approach to model this irradiation for different geometries of the primary X-ray source. These geometries include the standard point source on the rotational axis as well as more jet-like sources, which are radially elongated and accelerating. Incorporating this code in the relline model for relativistic line emission, the line shape for any configuration can be predicted. We study how different irradiation geometries affect the determination of the spin of the black hole. Broad emission lines are produced only for compact irradiating sources situated close to the black hole. This is the only case where the black hole spin can be unambiguously determined. In all other cases the line shape is narrower, which could either be explained by a low spin or an elongated source. We conclude that in those cases and independent of the quality of the data no unique solution for the spin exists and therefore only a lower limit of the spin value can be given.},

These high-signal-to-noise spectra enable us to examine the nature of this variable, obscured active galactic nucleus (AGN) in unprecedented detail on time-scales ranging from hours to years. We find that in addition to the power-law continuum and absorption from ionized gas seen in most AGN, inner disc reflection and variable absorption from neutral gas within the broad emission line region are both necessary components in all three observations. We confirm the clumpy nature of the cold absorbing gas, though we note that occultations of the inner disc and corona are much more pronounced in the high-flux state (2008) than in the low-flux state (2010) of the source. The onset and duration of the ‘dips’ in the X-ray light curve in 2010 are both significantly longer than in 2008, however, indicating that either the distance to the gas from the black hole is larger or the nature of the gas has changed between epochs. We also note significant variations in the power-law flux over time-scales similar to the cold absorber, both within and between the three observations. The warm absorber does not vary significantly within observations, but does show variations in column density of a factor of ≥10 on time-scales of ≤2 weeks that seem unrelated to the changes in the continuum, reflection or cold absorber. By assuming a uniform iron abundance for the reflection and absorption, we have also established that Fe/solar = 3.5+ 0.3− 0.1 is sufficient to model the broad-band spectrum without invoking an additional partial-covering absorber. Such a measurement is consistent with previous published constraints from the 2008 Suzaku observation alone, and with results from other Seyfert AGN in the literature.},

	abstract = {In the past five years, a flurry of X-ray reverberation lag measurements of accreting supermassive black holes have been made using the XMM–Newton telescope in the 0.3–10 keV energy range. In this work, we use the NuSTAR (Nuclear Spectroscopic Telescope Array) telescope to extend the lag analysis up to higher energies for two Seyfert galaxies, SWIFT J2127.4+5654 and NGC 1365. X-ray reverberation lags are due to the light travel time delays between the direct continuum emission and the reprocessed emission from the inner radii of an ionized accretion disc. XMM–Newton has been particularly adept at measuring the lag associated with the broad Fe K emission line, where the gravitationally redshifted wing of the line is observed to respond before the line centroid at 6.4 keV, produced at larger radii. Now, we use NuSTAR to probe the lag at higher energies, where the spectrum shows clear evidence for Compton reflection, known as the Compton ‘hump’. The XMM–Newton data show Fe K lags in both SWIFT J2127.4+5654 and NGC 1365. The NuSTAR data provide independent confirmation of these Fe K lags, and also show evidence for the corresponding Compton hump lags, especially in SWIFT J2127.4+5654. These broad-band lag measurements confirm that the Compton hump and Fe K lag are produced at small radii. At low frequencies in NGC 1365, where the spectrum shows evidence for eclipsing clouds in the line of sight, we find a clear negative (not positive) lag from 2 to 10 keV, which can be understood as the decrease in column density from a neutral eclipsing cloud moving out of our line of sight during the observation.},

The new kerrdisk model we have designed for simulating line emission from accretion disk systems allows black hole spin to be a free parameter in the fit, enabling the user to formally constrain the angular momentum of a black hole, among other physical parameters of the system. In an important extension of previous work, we derive constraints on the black hole spin in MCG -06-30-15 using a self-consistent model for X-ray reflection from the surface of the accretion disk while simultaneously accounting for absorption by dusty photoionized material along the line of sight (the warm absorber). Even including these complications, the XMM-Newton EPIC pn data require extreme relativistic broadening of the X-ray reflection spectrum; assuming no emission from within the radius of marginal stability, we derive a formal constraint on the dimensionless black hole spin parameter of a=0.989+0.009-0.002 at 90\% confidence. The principal unmodeled effect that can significantly reduce the inferred black hole spin is powerful emission from within the radius of marginal stability. Although significant theoretical developments are required to fully understand this region, we argue that the need for a rapidly spinning black hole is robust to physically plausible levels of emission from within the radius of marginal stability. In particular, we show that a nonrotating black hole is strongly ruled out.},

	abstract = {General relativity has been widely tested in weak gravitational fields but still stands largely untested in the strong-field regime. According to the no-hair theorem, black holes in general relativity depend only on their masses and spins and are described by the Kerr metric. Mass and spin are the first two multipole moments of the Kerr spacetime and completely determine all higher-order moments. The no-hair theorem and, hence, general relativity can be tested by measuring potential deviations from the Kerr metric affecting such higher-order moments. Sagittarius A* (Sgr A*), the supermassive black hole at the center of the Milky Way, is a prime target for precision tests of general relativity with several experiments across the electromagnetic spectrum. First, near-infrared (NIR) monitoring of stars orbiting around Sgr A* with current and new instruments is expected to resolve their orbital precessions. Second, timing observations of radio pulsars near the Galactic center may detect characteristic residuals induced by the spin and quadrupole moment of Sgr A*. Third, the event horizon telescope, a global network of mm and sub-mm telescopes, aims to study Sgr A* on horizon scales and to image the silhouette of its shadow cast against the surrounding accretion flow using very-long baseline interferometric (VLBI) techniques. Both NIR and VLBI observations may also detect quasiperiodic variability of the emission from the accretion flow of Sgr A*. In this review, I discuss our current understanding of the spacetime of Sgr A* and the prospects of NIR, timing, and VLBI observations to test its Kerr nature in the near future.},

	abstract = {We report on X-ray flares that were observed from the active galactic nucleus I Zwicky 1 (I Zw 1) in 2020 January by the NuSTAR and XMM-Newton observatories. The X-ray spectrum is well-described by a model comprised of the continuum emission from the corona and its reflection from the accretion disc around a rapidly spinning (a {\textgreater} 0.94) black hole. In order to model the broadband spectrum, it is necessary to account for the variation in ionisation across the disc. Analysis of the X-ray spectrum in time periods before, during and after the flares reveal the underlying changes to the corona associated with the flaring. During the flares, the reflection fraction drops significantly, consistent with the acceleration of the corona away from the accretion disc. We find the first evidence that during the X-ray flares, the temperature drops from 140(-20,+100)keV before to 45(-9,+40)keV during the flares. The profile of the iron K line reveals the emissivity profile of the accretion disc, showing it to be illuminated by a compact corona extending no more than 7(-2,+4)rg over the disc before the flares, but with tentative evidence that the corona expands as it is accelerated during the flares. Once the flares subsided, the corona had collapsed to a radius of 6(-2,+2)rg. The rapid timescale of the flares suggests that they arise within the black-hole magnetosphere rather than in the accretion disc, and the variation of the corona is consistent with the continuum arising from the Comptonisation of seed photons from the disc.},

	abstract = {The X-ray spectra of accretion discs of eight stellar mass black holes have been analysed to date using the thermal continuum-ﬁtting method, and the spectral ﬁts have been used to estimate the spin parameters of the black holes. However, the underlying model used in this method of estimating spin is the general relativistic thin-disc model of Novikov \& Thorne, which is only valid for razor-thin discs. We therefore expect errors in the measured values of spin due to inadequacies in the theoretical model. We investigate this issue by computing spectra of numerically calculated models of thin accretion discs around black holes, obtained via three-dimensional general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic (GRMHD) simulations. We apply the continuum-ﬁtting method to these computed spectra to estimate the black hole spins and check how closely the values match the actual spin used in the GRMHD simulations. We ﬁnd that the error in the dimensionless spin parameter is up to about 0.2 for a non-spinning black hole, depending on the inclination. For black holes with spins of 0.7, 0.9 and 0.98, the errors are up to about 0.1, 0.03 and 0.01, respectively. These errors are comparable to or smaller than those arising from current levels of observational uncertainty. Furthermore, we estimate that the GRMHD simulated discs from which these error estimates are obtained correspond to effective disc luminosities of about 0.4–0.7 Eddington, and that the errors will be smaller for discs with luminosities of 0.3 Eddington or less, which are used in the continuum-ﬁtting method. We thus conclude that use of the Novikov–Thorne thin-disc model does not presently limit the accuracy of the continuum-ﬁtting method of measuring black hole spin.},

	abstract = {We use a ray-tracing technique to compute the observed spectrum of a thin accretion disk around a Kerr black hole. We include all relativistic effects such as frame-dragging, Doppler boost, gravitational redshift, and bending of light by the gravity of the black hole. We also include self-irradiation of the disk as a result of light deflection. Assuming that the disk emission is locally blackbody, we show how the observed spectrum depends on the spin of the black hole, the inclination of the disk, and the torque at the inner edge of the disk. We find that the effect of a nonzero torque on the spectrum can, to a good approximation, be absorbed into a zero-torque model by adjusting the mass accretion rate and the normalization. We describe a computer model, called KERRBB, which we have developed for fitting the spectra of black hole X-ray binaries. Using KERRBB within the X-ray data reduction package XSPEC, and assuming a spectral hardening factor fcol=1.7, we analyze the spectra of three black hole X-ray binaries: 4U 1543-47, XTE J1550-564, and GRO J1655-40. We estimate the spin parameters of the black holes in 4U 1543-47 and GRO J1655-40 to be a/M{\textasciitilde}0.6 and {\textasciitilde}0.6-0.7, respectively. If fcol{\textasciitilde}1.5-1.6, as in a recent study, then we find a/M{\textasciitilde}0.7-0.8 and {\textasciitilde}0.8-0.9, respectively. These estimates are subject to additional uncertainties in the assumed black hole masses, distances, and disk inclinations.},

In this paper, we report the results of pulsation searches in all of these data sets and find only one new detection. This new detection allows us to refine the orbital period of the source and measure an average spin-down rate between 2014 and 2016 of ∼-6 × 10-11 Hz s-1, which is in contrast to the strong spin-up seen during the 2014 observations, representing the first detection of spin-down in a PULX system. Thanks to the improved orbital solution allowed by this new detection, we are also able to detect pulsations in additional segments of the original 2014 data set. We find a glitch superimposed on the very strong and variable spin-up already reported - the first positive glitch identified in a PULX system. We discuss the new findings in the context of current leading models for PULXs.},

	abstract = {General-relativistic magnetohydrodynamic (GRMHD) simulations have revolutionized our understanding of black-hole accretion. Here, we present a GPU-accelerated GRMHD code H-AMR with multi-faceted optimizations that, collectively, accelerate computation by 2-5 orders of magnitude for a wide range of applications. Firstly, it involves a novel implementation of a spherical-polar grid with 3D adaptive mesh reﬁnement that operates in each of the 3 dimensions independently. This allows us to circumvent the Courant condition near the polar singularity, which otherwise cripples high-res computational performance. Secondly, we demonstrate that local adaptive time-stepping (LAT) on a logarithmic spherical-polar grid accelerates computation by a factor of 10 compared to traditional hierarchical time-stepping approaches. Jointly, these unique features lead to an eﬀective speed of ∼ 109 zone-cyclesper-second-per-node on 5,400 NVIDIA V100 GPUs (i.e., 900 nodes of the OLCF Summit supercomputer). We demonstrate its computational performance by presenting the ﬁrst GRMHD simulation of a tilted thin accretion disk threaded by a toroidal magnetic ﬁeld around a rapidly spinning black hole. With an eﬀective resolution of 13,440 × 4,608 × 8,092 cells, and a total of 22 billion cells and ∼ 0.65 × 108 timesteps, it is among the largest astrophysical simulations ever performed. We ﬁnd that frame-dragging by the black hole tears up the disk into two independently precessing sub-disks. The innermost sub-disk rotation axis intermittently aligns with the black hole spin, demonstrating for the ﬁrst time that such long-sought alignment is possible in the absence of large-scale poloidal magnetic ﬁelds.},

	abstract = {Accreting black holes commonly exhibit hard X-ray emission, originating from a region of hot plasma near the central engine referred to as the corona. The origin and geometry of the corona are poorly understood, and models invoking either inflowing or outflowing material (or both) can successfully explain only parts of the observed phenomenology. In particular, recent works indicate that the time-averaged and variability property might originate in different regions of the corona. In this paper we present a model designed to move beyond the lamp post paradigm, with the goal of accounting for the vertical extent of the corona. In particular, we highlight the impact of including self consistently a second lamp post, mimicking for example an extended jet base. We fully include the effect that the second source has on the time-dependent disk ionization, reflection spectrum, and reverberation lags. We also present an application of this new model to NICER observations of the X-ray binary MAXI J1820+070 near its hard-to-soft state transition. We demonstrate that in these observations, a vertically extended corona can capture both spectral and timing properties, while a single lamp post model can not. In this scenario, the illumination responsible for the time-averaged spectrum originates close to the black hole, while the variability is likely associated with the ballistic jet.},
